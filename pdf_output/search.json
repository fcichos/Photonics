    "text": "2.0.1 Ray Optics\nLight has been described through increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks throughout the history of physics. The simplest framework is Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics, which treats light as rays traveling along straight paths and applies geometrical principles to describe interactions with optical elements like lenses and mirrors. Moving beyond this approximation, Wave Optics introduces the wave nature of light, explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction that ray optics cannot address. Electromagnetic Optics further refines our understanding by treating light as electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell’s equations, providing a complete classical description of light-matter interactions. For intense light sources, Nonlinear Optics becomes essential, describing how materials respond nonlinearly to strong electromagnetic fields, giving rise to frequency conversion and other novel effects. Finally, at the most fundamental level, Quantum Optics treats light as consisting of photons—quantum mechanical particles exhibiting both wave and particle properties—essential for understanding phenomena like spontaneous emission, entanglement, and the quantum nature of light-matter interactions. This course will progressively build your understanding through these increasingly sophisticated frameworks.\nRay optics, or geometric optics, provides a powerful framework for understanding light propagation when the wavelength is much smaller than the dimensions of optical elements involved. In this approach, light travels along straight lines called rays in homogeneous media, with well-defined paths that can be mathematically traced. This description serves as the foundation for analyzing many optical systems, from simple mirrors to complex microscopes and telescopes.",

    "text": "2.1 Fermat’s Principle for Spherical Surfaces\nThe power of Fermat’s principle becomes particularly evident when applied to spherical refracting surfaces. Consider a spherical boundary of radius \\(R\\) between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). According to Fermat’s principle, light will follow the path that minimizes the total optical path length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12— Fermat’s principle applied to a spherical refracting surface\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we apply Fermat’s principle to a spherical surface, we can derive the laws of refraction. Consider a spherical boundary between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). We’ll place our coordinate system so that the spherical surface intersects the x-axis at x=0, with radius R and its center at position (R,0) to the right.\nFor a point P on the spherical surface at height y from the optical axis, the total optical path length from object point A at (-a,0) to image point B at (b,0) is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nwhere: \\[|AP| = \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}\\] \\[|PB| = \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, light follows the path where this length is stationary:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dy} = n_1\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} + n_2\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = 0\\]\nComputing these derivatives:\n\\[\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|AP|}\\] \\[\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|PB|}\\]\nSubstituting into our condition:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = 0\\]\nThis equation is incorrect. The right-hand side should not be zero because we need to account for the geometry of the spherical surface. The correct form includes the effect of the surface normal:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = \\frac{(n_2-n_1)y}{R}\\]\nThis correction comes from the fact that at point P, the normal to the spherical surface makes an angle α with the optical axis, where sin(α) ≈ y/R in the paraxial approximation.\nDividing by y (assuming y≠0):\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{|AP|} + \\frac{n_2}{|PB|} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nIn the paraxial approximation, we can use |AP| ≈ a and |PB| ≈ b, yielding:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a} + \\frac{n_2}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nThis is the correct imaging equation for a spherical refracting surface.\nThe elegance of Fermat’s principle is preserved, as it still naturally produces the same result as our geometric derivation, once we properly account for the geometry of the refracting surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving the Thin Lens Equation from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the thin lens equation, we apply Fermat’s principle to the two spherical surfaces that make up a lens. Consider a lens with refractive index \\(n_2\\) in a medium of index \\(n_1\\), with surface radii \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\).\nThe total optical path for a ray passing through the lens at height \\(y\\) from the optical axis is: - Path from object to first surface: \\(n_1 s_1\\) - Path through the lens: \\(n_2 s_2\\) - Path from second surface to image: \\(n_1 s_3\\)\nFor a thin lens, the optical path length simplifies to:\n\\[L(y) = n_1 \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2} + n_2 d(y) + n_1 \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nWhere \\(d(y)\\) is the thickness of the lens at height \\(y\\), which can be approximated as:\n\\[d(y) \\approx d_0 + \\frac{y^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)\\]\nApplying Fermat’s principle (\\(\\frac{dL}{dy} = 0\\)) and using the paraxial approximation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}} = 0\\]\nIn the paraxial limit (\\(y \\ll a, y \\ll b\\)), this becomes:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{a} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{b} = 0\\]\nDividing by \\(y\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis is the thin lens equation with the focal length given by the lensmaker’s equation:\n\\[f = \\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left(\\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2-R_1}\\right)\\]\nThus, both the imaging equation and the lensmaker equation emerge naturally from Fermat’s principle applied to the geometry of a thin lens, showing that light follows paths of equal optical length from object to image when passing through any part of the lens.\nFrom a wave perspective, what makes a lens focus light to a point is that all paths from object to image through any part of the lens have equal optical path lengths (to first order in the paraxial approximation), ensuring constructive interference at the image point.",

This approach explains effects that cannot be accounted for by ray tracing alone, such as:\nLight is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which spans an enormous range of frequencies. The visible region, extending approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), represents only a small fraction of this spectrum. This wave description is essential for understanding many optical phenomena that geometric optics cannot explain, particularly when dealing with structures comparable in size to the wavelength of light.\nIn the following, we would like to introduce wave by discarding the fact, that light is related to electric and magnetic fields. This is useful as the vectorial nature of the electric and magnetic field further complicates the calculations, but we do not need those yet. Accordingly we also do not understand how light really interacts with matter and we therefore have to introduce some postulates as well.",

By definition, such a wave must be infinite in time and free from phase disturbances (such as sudden jumps).

This equation describes the spatial behavior of monochromatic waves.\n\n\n3.1.2.2 Intensity of Waves\nThe intensity of a wave at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and time \\(t\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nI(\\mathbf{r},t)=2\\langle u^2(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rangle\n\\]\nwhere \\(I\\) is measured in units of \\(\\left[\\frac{W}{m^2}\\right]\\). The angle brackets \\(\\langle \\ldots \\rangle\\) represent a time average over one oscillation cycle of \\(u\\). For visible light, this averaging occurs over an extremely brief period - for example, light with a wavelength of 600 nm has a cycle duration of just 2 femtoseconds.\nThe optical power \\(P\\) of a wave can be calculated by integrating the intensity over a surface area \\(A\\):\n\\[\nP=\\int_A I(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, dA\n\\]\nInserting the seperation of the complex wavefunction into spatial and temporal components leads to the following expression for the intensity:\n\\[\nI(\\mathbf{r})=|U(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n\\]\nThus the physical quantity forming the spatial and temporal oscillation of the wavefunction is also providing the intensity of the wave when its magnitude is squared. This is a fundamental property of wavefunctions and for example not the case when temperature oscillates in space and time in a medium.\n\n\n3.1.2.3 Wavefronts\nWavefronts are surfaces in space where the phase is constant:\n\\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r})=\\text{const}\n\\]\nTypically, this constant is chosen to represent points of maximum spatial amplitude, such that:\n\\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r})=2\\pi q\n\\]\nwhere \\(q\\) is an integer.\nThe direction normal to these wavefronts can be described by the gradient vector:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{n}=\\nabla\\phi=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)\n\\]\nThis vector \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is always perpendicular to the wavefront surface and points in the direction of wave propagation. The evolution of these wavefronts in time provides important information about the wave’s propagation characteristics.",

This principle, which states that the net response to multiple stimuli is the sum of the individual responses, is central to our understanding of wave physics. Interference appears across many domains of physics: in optics where it enables high-precision measurements and holography, in quantum mechanics where it reveals the wave nature of matter, and in acoustics where it forms the basis for noise cancellation technology. The ability of waves to interfere constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively (canceling each other) has profound practical applications, from the anti-reflective coatings on optical elements to the operational principles of interferometric gravitational wave detectors like LIGO. Understanding interference is therefore not just of theoretical interest but crucial for modern technology and experimental physics.\nWhen two wave solutions \\(U_1(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(U_2(\\mathbf{r})\\) combine, their superposition gives:\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r})=U_1(\\mathbf{r})+U_2(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\nThe resulting intensity is:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\nI &= &|U|^2\\\\\n&= &|U_1+U_2|^2\\\\\n&= &|U_1|^2+|U_2|^2+U^{*}_1 U_2 + U_1 U^{*}_2\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nThe individual wave intensities are given by \\(I_1=|U_1|^2\\) and \\(I_2=|U_2|^2\\).

The equation then simplifies to:\n\\[\nI=2I_0(1+\\cos(\\Delta \\phi))=4I_0\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nThis last form clearly shows that:\n\nMaximum intensity (\\(4I_0\\)) occurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi n\\) (constructive interference)\nZero intensity occurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi = (2n+1)\\pi\\) (destructive interference)\nThe intensity varies sinusoidally with the phase difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive Interference\n\n\n\nOccurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi m\\) (where \\(m\\) is an integer), resulting in \\(I=4I_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive interference of two waves (top, middle) and the sum of the two wave amplitudes (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive Interference\n\n\n\nOccurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi=(2m-1)\\pi\\) (where \\(m\\) is an integer), resulting in \\(I=0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive interference of two waves (top, middle) and the sum of the two wave amplitudes (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.1 Phase and Path Difference\nThe phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) can be related to the path difference \\(\\Delta s\\) between the two waves. For two waves with the same frequency \\(\\omega\\), we can write their complete phase expressions as:\n\\[\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{k}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t + \\phi_{01}\\] \\[\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{k}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t + \\phi_{02}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{k}_i\\) are the wave vectors\n\\(\\mathbf{r}\\) is the position vector\n\\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency\n\\(\\phi_{0i}\\) are initial phase constants\n\nThe instantaneous phase difference is then:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\phi_2(\\mathbf{r},t) - \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = (\\mathbf{k}_2-\\mathbf{k}_1)\\cdot\\mathbf{r} + (\\phi_{02}-\\phi_{01})\n\\]\nFor stationary interference patterns, we typically observe the time-independent phase difference. When the waves travel along similar paths (same direction), this reduces to:\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = k\\Delta s + \\Delta\\phi_0\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta s\\) is the path difference and \\(\\Delta\\phi_0\\) is any initial phase difference between the sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase Difference and Path Difference\n\n\n\nA path difference \\(\\Delta s\\) corresponds to a phase difference \\(k\\Delta s=2\\pi\\Delta s/\\lambda\\). Path differences of integer multiples of \\(\\lambda\\) result in phase differences of integer multiples of \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.0.2 Interference of Waves in Space\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference of two plane waves propagating under an angle of 45°. The two left graphs show the original waves. The two right show the total amplitude and the intensity pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference of a spherical wave and a plane wave. The top graphs show the original waves. The two bottom show the total amplitude and the intensity pattern.\n\n\n\n\nThe interference of the spherical and the plane wave (also the one of the two plane waves) give also an interesting result. The intensity resembles to be a snapshot of the shape of the wavefronts of the spherical wave. We can therefore measure the wavefronts of the spherical wave by interfering it with a plane wave. This is also the basic principle behind holography. There we use a reference wave to interfere with the wave that we want to measure. The interference pattern is recorded and can be used to reconstruct the wavefronts of the wave.\n\nA super nice website to try out interference interactively is here.\n\n\n\n4.0.3 Coherence\nIn the earlier consideration we obtained a general description for the phase difference between two waves. TIt is given by and contains the pathlength difference \\(\\Delta s\\) and some intrinsic phase \\(\\Delta\\phi_0\\) that could be part of the wave generation process.\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = k\\Delta s + \\Delta\\phi_0\\]\nTo observe stationary interference, it is important that these two quantities are also stationary, i.e. the phase relation between the two waves is stationary. This relation between the phase of two waves is called coherence and was assumed in all the examples before.\n\n\n\nTwo waves of different frequency over time.\n\n\nThe above image shows the timetrace of the amplitude of two wave with slightly different frequency. Due to the frequency, the waves run out of phase and have acquired a phase different of \\(\\pi\\) after \\(40\\) fs.\nThe temporal coherence of two waves is now defined by the time it takes for the two waves to obtain a phase difference of \\(2\\pi\\). The phase difference between two wave of frequency \\(\\nu_1\\) and \\(\\nu_2\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi (\\nu_2-\\nu_1)(t-t_0)\n\\]\nHere \\(t_0\\) refers to the time, when thw two waves were perfectly in sync. Lets assume that the two frequencies are seperarated from a central frequency \\(\\nu_0\\) such that\n\\[\n\\nu_1=\\nu_0-\\Delta \\nu/2\n\\] \\[\n\\nu_2=\\nu_0+\\Delta \\nu/2\n\\]\nInserting this into the first equation yields\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi \\Delta \\nu \\Delta t\n\\]\nwith \\(\\Delta t=t-t_0\\). We can now define the coherence time as the time interval over which the phase shift \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) grows to \\(2\\pi\\), i.e. \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi\\). The coherence time is thus\n\\[\n\\tau_{c}=\\Delta t =\\frac{1}{\\Delta \\nu}\n\\]\nThus the temporal coherence and the frequency distribution of the light are intrisincly connected. Monochromatic light has \\(\\Delta nu=0\\) and thus the coherence time is infinitely long. Light with a wide spectrum (white light for example) therefore has and extremly short coherence time.\nThe coherence time is also connected to a coherence length. The coherence length \\(L_c\\) is given by the distance light travels within the coherence time \\(\\tau_c\\), i.e.\n\\[\nL_c=c\\tau_c\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoherence\n\n\n\nTwo waves are called coherent, if they exihibit a fixed phase relation in space or time relation over time. It measures their ability to interfer. The main types of coherence are\n\n4.0.4 Temporal Coherence\n\nMeasures phase correlation of a wave with itself at different times\nCharacterized by coherence time \\(\\tau_c\\) and coherence length \\(L_c = c\\tau_c\\)\nRelated to spectral width: \\(\\tau_c = 1/\\Delta\\nu\\)\nPerfect for monochromatic waves (single frequency)\nLimited for broad spectrum sources (like thermal light)\n\n\n\n4.0.5 Spatial Coherence\n\nMeasures phase correlation between different points in space\nImportant for interference from extended sources\nDetermines ability to form interference patterns\nRelated to source size and geometry\n\nCoherence is a property of the light source and is connected to the frequency distribution of the light. Sources can be:\n\nFully coherent: ideal laser\nPartially coherent: real laser\nIncoherent: thermal light\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore General Description of Coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the above definition provides an intuitive picture based on frequency spread, we can describe coherence more rigorously using correlation functions. These functions measure how well a wave maintains its phase relationships:\nIn real physical systems, perfect coherence (constant phase relationship) between waves is rare. Partial coherence describes the degree to which waves maintain a consistent phase relationship over time and space. We can characterize this using correlation functions:\n\nTemporal Coherence The complex degree of temporal coherence is given by:\n\n\\[g^{(1)}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\langle U(t)U^*(t+\\tau)\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle|U(t)|^2\\rangle\\langle|U(t+\\tau)|^2\\rangle}}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\tau\\) is the time delay\n\\(U(t)\\) is the electric field\n\\(\\langle...\\rangle\\) denotes time averaging\n\n\nSpatial Coherence Similarly, spatial coherence between two points is characterized by:\n\n\\[g^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{\\langle U(\\mathbf{r}_1)U^*(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle|U(\\mathbf{r}_1)|^2\\rangle\\langle|U(\\mathbf{r}_2)|^2\\rangle}}\\]\nThe obtained correlation functions can be used to calculate the coherence time and length and have the following properties:\n\n\\(|g^{(1)}| = 1\\) indicates perfect coherence\n\\(|g^{(1)}| = 0\\) indicates complete incoherence\n\\(0 &lt; |g^{(1)}| &lt; 1\\) indicates partial coherence\n\nA finite coherence time and length is leads to partial coherence affects interference visibility through:\n\nReduced contrast in interference patterns\nLimited coherence length/area\nSpectral broadening\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal correlation for two waves with slightly different frequencies. The vertical line indicates the coherence time τc = π/Δω.\n\n\n\n\nBesides different frequencies the coherence time can also be affected by phase jumps. The following example shows two waves with the same frequency but multiple phase jumps. The temporal correlation function shows the decoherence due to the phase jumps.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal correlation for two waves of same frequency showing decoherence due to multiple phase jumps. Vertical lines indicate positions of phase jumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference\nSo far we looked at the interference of two waves, which was a simplification as I mentioned already earlier. Commonly there will be a multitude of partial waves contribute to the oberved intereference. This is what we would like to have a look at now. We will do that in a quite general fashion, as the resulting formulas will appear several times again for different problems.\nNevertheless we will make a difference between\n\nmultiwave interference of waves with the constant amplitude\nmultiwave interference of waves with decreasing amplitude\n\nEspecially the latter is often occuring, if we have multiple reflections and each reflection is only a fraction of the incident amplitude.\n\n\n4.0.6 Multiple Wave Interference with Constant Amplitude\nIn the case of constant amplitude (for example realized by a grating, which we talk about later), the total wave amplitude is given according to the picture below by\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_1+U_3+\\ldots+U_M\n\\]\nwhere we sum the amplitude over \\(M\\) partial waves. Between the neighboring waves (e.g. \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\)), we will assume a phase difference (because of a path length difference for example), which we denote as \\(\\Delta \\phi\\).\nThe amplitude of the p-th wave is then given by\n\\[\nU_p=\\sqrt{I_0}e^{i(p-1)\\Delta \\phi}\n\\]\nwith the index \\(p\\) being an interger \\(p=1,2,\\ldots,M\\), \\(h=e^{i\\Delta \\phi}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\) as the amplitude of each individual wave. The total amplitude \\(U\\) can be then expressed as\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\left (1+h+h^2+\\ldots +h^{M-1}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich is a geometric sum. We can apply the sum formula for geometric sums to obtain\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{1-h^M}{1-h}=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{1-e^{iM\\Delta \\phi}}{1-e^{i\\Delta \\phi}}\n\\]\nWe now have to calculate the intensity of the total amplitude\n\\[\nI=|U|^2=I_{0}\\left | \\frac{e^{-iM\\Delta \\phi/2}-e^{iM\\Delta \\phi/2}}{e^{-i\\Delta \\phi/2}-e^{i\\Delta \\phi/2}}\\right |^2\n\\]\nwhich we can further simplify to give\n\\[\nI=I_{0}\\frac{\\sin^2(M\\Delta \\phi/2)}{\\sin^2(\\Delta \\phi/2)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple wave interference of \\(M=6\\) waves with a phase difference of \\(\\phi=\\pi/8\\). The black arrows represent the individual waves, the red arrow the sum of all waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1— Multiple beam interference pattern for M=6 beams. The intensity distribution is shown as a function of the phase shift \\(\\phi\\). The first minimum is at \\(\\phi=2\\pi/M\\). The intensity distribution is symmetric around \\(\\phi=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is therefore an oscillating function. The numerator \\(\\sin^2(M\\Delta \\phi/2)\\) shows and oscillation frequency, which is by a factor of \\(M\\) higher than the one in the denominator \\(\\sin^2 (\\Delta \\phi/2)\\). Therefore the intensity pattern is oscillating rapidly and creating a first minimum at\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=\\frac{2\\pi}{M}\n\\]\nThis is an important result, since it shows that the number of sources \\(M\\) determines the position of the first minimum and the interference peak gets narrower with increasing \\(M\\). Since the phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) between neighboring sources is the same as for the double slit experiment, i.e. \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi d/\\lambda \\sin(\\theta)\\), we can also determine the angular position of the first minimum. This is given by\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_\\textrm{min})=\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\n\\]\nThis again has the common feature that it scales as \\(\\lambda/d\\). A special situation occurs, whenever the numerator and the denominator become zero. This will happen whenever\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=m 2\\pi\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is an integer and denotes the interference order, i.e. the number of wavelength that neighboring partial waves have as path length difference. In this case, the intensity distributiion will give us\n\\[\nI=I_0 \\frac{0}{0}\n\\]\nand we have to determine the limit with the help of l’Hospitals rule. The outcome of this calculation is, that\n\\[\nI(\\Delta \\phi=m2\\Delta \\pi)=M^2 I_0\n\\]\nwhich can be also realized when using the small angle approximation for the sine functions.\n\n4.0.6.1 Wavevector Representation\nWe would like to introduce a different representation of the multiple wave interference of the grating, which is quite insightful. The first order (\\(m=1\\)) constructive interference condition is given by\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sin{\\theta}= \\frac{1}{d}\n\\]\nwhich also means that\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\sin{\\theta}= \\frac{2\\pi}{d}\n\\]\nThis can be written as\n\\[\nk \\sin{\\theta}= K\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the magnitude of the wavevector of the light and \\(K\\) is the wavevector magnitude that corresponds to the grating period \\(d\\). As the magnitude of the wavevector of the light is conserved, the wavevectors of the incident light and the light traveling along the direction of the first interence peak form the sides of an equilateral triangle. This is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWavevector summation for the diffraction grating. The wavevector of the incident light \\(k\\) and the wavevector of the light traveling along the direction of the first interference peak \\(K\\) form an equilateral triangle.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the diffraction grating is providing a wavevector \\(K\\) to alter the direction of the incident light. This is again a common feature reappearing in many situations as for example in the X-ray diffraction of crystals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference with Decreasing Amplitude\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will turn our attention now to a slight modification of the previous multiwave interference. We will introduce a decreasing amplitude of the individual waves. The first wave shall have an amplitude \\(U_1=\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The next wave, however, will not only be phase shifted but also have a smaller amplitude.\n\\[\nU_2=h U_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(h=re^{i\\phi}\\) with \\(|h|=r&lt;1\\). \\(r\\) can be regarded as a reflection coefficient, which deminishes the amplitude of the incident wave. According to that the intensity is reduced by\n\\[\nI_2=|U_2|^2=|h U_1|^2=r^2 I_1\n\\]\nThe intensity of the incident wave is multiplied by a factor \\(r^2\\), while the amplitude is multiplied by \\(r\\). Note that the phase factor \\(e^{i\\Delta\\phi}\\) is removed when taking the square of this complex number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity at Boundaries\n\n\n\nThe amplitude of the reflected wave is diminished by a factor \\(r\\le 1\\), which is called the reflection coefficient. The intensity is diminished by a factor \\(R=|r|^2\\le1\\), which is the reflectance.\nIn the absence of absorption, reflectance \\(R\\) and transmittance \\(T\\) add to one due to energy conservation.\n\\[\nR+T=1\n\\]\n\n\nConsequently, the third wave would be now \\(U_3=hU_2=h^2U_1\\). The total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_3+\\ldots+U_M = \\sqrt{I_0}(1+h+h^2+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase construction of a multiwave intereference with M waves with decreasing amplitude due to a reflection coefficient \\(r=0.95\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple wave interference with decreasing amplitude. The graph shows the intensity distribution over the phase angle \\(\\phi\\) for different values of the Finesse \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis yields again\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{(1-h^M)}{1-h}=\\frac{\\sqrt{I_0}}{1-r e^{i\\Delta\\phi}}\n\\]\nCalculating the intensity of the waves is giving\n\\[\nI=|U|^2=\\frac{I_{0}}{|1-re^{i\\Delta\\phi}|^2}=\\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2+4r\\sin^2(\\Delta\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nwhich is also known as the Airy function. This function can be further simplified by the following abbrevations\n\\[\nI_{\\rm max}=\\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\mathcal{F}=\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{r}}{1-r}\n\\]\nwhere the latter is called the Finesse. With those abbrevations, we obtain\n\\[\nI=\\frac{I_{\\rm max}}{1+4\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{F}}{\\pi}\\right)^2\\sin^{2}(\\Delta\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nfor the interference of multiple waves with decreasing amplitude.\nThis intensity distribution has a different shape than the one we obtained for multiple waves with the same amplitude.\nWe clearly observe that with increasing Finesse the intensity maxima, which occur at multiples fo \\(\\pi\\) get much narrower. In addition the regions between the maxima show better contrast and fopr higher Finesse we get complete destructive interference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.0.7 Light beating\n\n4.0.7.1 Beating of two waves\nLet us consider now interference in the time domain. We introduce two monochromatic waves of frequencies \\(\\nu_1\\) and \\(\\nu_2\\). We will denote their amplitudes by \\(\\sqrt{I_1}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_2}\\).\nThe total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2 = \\sqrt{I_1} \\exp(i2\\pi\\nu_1 t) + \\sqrt{I_2} \\exp(i2\\pi\\nu_2 t)\n\\]\nsuch that we obtain an Intensity\n\\[\nI=|U|^2 = I_1 + I_2 + 2\\sqrt{I_1I_2}\\cos(2\\pi(\\nu_1-\\nu_2)t)\n\\]\nThe intensity is thus time dependent and oscillates at a frequency \\(\\nu_1-\\nu_2\\), which is the so-called beating frequency. Similar schemes are used in optical heterodyne detection but also in acoustics when tuning your guitar.\n\n\n4.0.7.2 Multiple wave beating and pulse generation\nConsider now a whole set of \\(M=2L+1\\) each with an amplitude \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The frequencies of the waves are given by \\(\\nu_q=\\nu_0+q\\Delta\\nu\\) with \\(q=-L,\\dots,L\\) with \\(\\nu_0\\) beeing the center frequency of the spectrum and \\(\\Delta \\nu\\) the frequency spacing. We will assume that \\(\\Delta nu&lt;&lt;\\nu_0\\) such that the total amplitude of the waves is given by\n\\[\nU=\\sum_{q=-L}^L \\sqrt{I_0} \\exp(i2\\pi(\\nu_0+q\\Delta\\nu)t)\n\\]\nThe total intensity can then be calculated in the same way as for the multiple source in space before. Using \\(\\phi=2\\pi \\Delta \\nu t\\) we obtained \\[\nI(t)=I_0 \\frac{\\sin^2(M\\pi t/T)}{\\sin^2(\\pi t/T)}\n\\]\nwith \\(T=1/\\Delta\\nu\\) and a maximum intensity of \\(I_{\\rm max}=M^2 I_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2— Multiple wave beating with M=1000 monochromatic waves separated by Δν=1 GHz. The intensity oscillates with period T=1/Δν=1 ns. Each pulse has a width of approximately T/M=1 ps with maximum intensity I_max=M²I₀.",
