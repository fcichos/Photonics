    "text": "2.0.1 Ray Optics\nLight has been described through increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks throughout the history of physics. The simplest framework is Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics, which treats light as rays traveling along straight paths and applies geometrical principles to describe interactions with optical elements like lenses and mirrors. Moving beyond this approximation, Wave Optics introduces the wave nature of light, explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction that ray optics cannot address. Electromagnetic Optics further refines our understanding by treating light as electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell’s equations, providing a complete classical description of light-matter interactions. For intense light sources, Nonlinear Optics becomes essential, describing how materials respond nonlinearly to strong electromagnetic fields, giving rise to frequency conversion and other novel effects. Finally, at the most fundamental level, Quantum Optics treats light as consisting of photons—quantum mechanical particles exhibiting both wave and particle properties—essential for understanding phenomena like spontaneous emission, entanglement, and the quantum nature of light-matter interactions. This course will progressively build your understanding through these increasingly sophisticated frameworks.\nRay optics, or geometric optics, provides a powerful framework for understanding light propagation when the wavelength is much smaller than the dimensions of optical elements involved. In this approach, light travels along straight lines called rays in homogeneous media, with well-defined paths that can be mathematically traced. This description serves as the foundation for analyzing many optical systems, from simple mirrors to complex microscopes and telescopes.",

    "text": "2.1 Fermat’s Principle for Spherical Surfaces\nThe power of Fermat’s principle becomes particularly evident when applied to spherical refracting surfaces. Consider a spherical boundary of radius \\(R\\) between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). According to Fermat’s principle, light will follow the path that minimizes the total optical path length.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12— Fermat’s principle applied to a spherical refracting surface\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we apply Fermat’s principle to a spherical surface, we can derive the laws of refraction. Consider a spherical boundary between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). We’ll place our coordinate system so that the spherical surface intersects the x-axis at x=0, with radius R and its center at position (R,0) to the right.\nFor a point P on the spherical surface at height y from the optical axis, the total optical path length from object point A at (-a,0) to image point B at (b,0) is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nwhere: \\[|AP| = \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}\\] \\[|PB| = \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, light follows the path where this length is stationary:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dy} = n_1\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} + n_2\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = 0\\]\nComputing these derivatives:\n\\[\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|AP|}\\] \\[\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|PB|}\\]\nSubstituting into our condition:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = 0\\]\nThis equation is incorrect. The right-hand side should not be zero because we need to account for the geometry of the spherical surface. The correct form includes the effect of the surface normal:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = \\frac{(n_2-n_1)y}{R}\\]\nThis correction comes from the fact that at point P, the normal to the spherical surface makes an angle α with the optical axis, where sin(α) ≈ y/R in the paraxial approximation.\nDividing by y (assuming y≠0):\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{|AP|} + \\frac{n_2}{|PB|} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nIn the paraxial approximation, we can use |AP| ≈ a and |PB| ≈ b, yielding:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a} + \\frac{n_2}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nThis is the correct imaging equation for a spherical refracting surface.\nThe elegance of Fermat’s principle is preserved, as it still naturally produces the same result as our geometric derivation, once we properly account for the geometry of the refracting surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving the Thin Lens Equation from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the thin lens equation, we apply Fermat’s principle to the two spherical surfaces that make up a lens. Consider a lens with refractive index \\(n_2\\) in a medium of index \\(n_1\\), with surface radii \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\).\nThe total optical path for a ray passing through the lens at height \\(y\\) from the optical axis is: - Path from object to first surface: \\(n_1 s_1\\) - Path through the lens: \\(n_2 s_2\\) - Path from second surface to image: \\(n_1 s_3\\)\nFor a thin lens, the optical path length simplifies to:\n\\[L(y) = n_1 \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2} + n_2 d(y) + n_1 \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nWhere \\(d(y)\\) is the thickness of the lens at height \\(y\\), which can be approximated as:\n\\[d(y) \\approx d_0 + \\frac{y^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)\\]\nApplying Fermat’s principle (\\(\\frac{dL}{dy} = 0\\)) and using the paraxial approximation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}} = 0\\]\nIn the paraxial limit (\\(y \\ll a, y \\ll b\\)), this becomes:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{a} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{b} = 0\\]\nDividing by \\(y\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis is the thin lens equation with the focal length given by the lensmaker’s equation:\n\\[f = \\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left(\\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2-R_1}\\right)\\]\nThus, both the imaging equation and the lensmaker equation emerge naturally from Fermat’s principle applied to the geometry of a thin lens, showing that light follows paths of equal optical length from object to image when passing through any part of the lens.\nFrom a wave perspective, what makes a lens focus light to a point is that all paths from object to image through any part of the lens have equal optical path lengths (to first order in the paraxial approximation), ensuring constructive interference at the image point.",

    "text": "3.0.1 Refraction at Spherical Surfaces\nWhen light encounters a spherical boundary between two media, we can analyze its path using Snell’s law and geometric considerations as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1— Refraction at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nTo determine how an image forms, we need to find where rays originating from a point at distance \\(a\\) from the surface will converge after refraction. Using Snell’s law for a ray hitting the surface at angle \\(\\alpha+\\theta_1\\):\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWhere: \\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nFor practical optical systems, we employ the paraxial approximation, where all angles are assumed small enough that:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta+ O(\\theta^{3}), \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta + O(\\theta^{3}),\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1 + O(\\theta^{2})\\]\nThis simplifies Snell’s law to:\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nAfter appropriate transformations (detailed in the online lecture), we obtain:\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1\\]\nand\n\\[y=y_1=y_2\\]\nThis linear relationship between input (\\(y\\), \\(\\theta_1\\)) and output (\\(y\\),\\(\\theta_2\\)) parameters is a hallmark of paraxial optics and a result of the linearization of Snells law.\n\n\n3.0.2 Matrix Optics\nThe linear relation between input and output parameters allows us to express optical elements as linear transformations (matrices). This approach forms the foundation of matrix optics. For a lens, the matrix representation is:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThis 2×2 matrix is called the ABCD matrix of the lens. Thanks to the linearization of Snell’s law, we can generalize this to any optical element:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\\n\\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nEach element in the ABCD matrix has a specific physical meaning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix Element\nPhysical Meaning\n\n\n\n\nA\nMagnification - relates output position to input position\n\n\nB\nPosition-to-angle conversion - relates output position to input angle\n\n\nC\nFocusing power - relates output angle to input position\n\n\nD\nAngular magnification - relates output angle to input angle\n\n\n\nEvery optical element can be characterized by these parameters. For example, a lens has C = -1/f (focusing power), while free space has B = d (position-dependent angle change). An important property is that the determinant of the matrix equals the ratio of refractive indices: det(M) = n₁/n₂, which equals 1 in a single medium.\nHere are the ABCD matrices for common optical elements:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix} =\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & d \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Free space}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Planar interface}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{\\left(n_2-n_1\\right)}{n_2 R} & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Spherical Boundary}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Thin Lens}\n\\]\nFor a system containing multiple optical elements, we simply multiply their matrices in the order that light passes through them:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{M}=\\mathbf{M}_N \\cdots \\mathbf{M}_2 \\mathbf{M}_1\n\\]\nA ray entering the first optical element at a height \\(y_1\\) at an angle \\(\\theta_1\\) is transformed according to the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) by the whole system. This elegant approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex optical systems efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Optical Cloaking with Lens Systems\n\n\n\n\n\nOptical cloaking refers to making objects “invisible” by guiding light rays around them such that to an observer, it appears as if the rays traveled through free space without encountering any object. Using matrix optics, we can design such a system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2— Example of a practical paraxial cloak. (a)–(c) A hand is cloaked for varying directions, while the background image is transmitted properly.(d) On-axis view of the ray optics cloaking device. (e) Setup using practical, easy to obtain optics, for demonstrating paraxial cloaking principles. (Photos by J. Adam Fenster, videos by Matthew Mann / University of Rochester) Source\n\n\n\nFor perfect optical cloaking, the ABCD matrix of our system must be equivalent to that of free space:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{cloaking} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhere \\(d\\) is the total effective optical path length. Let’s explore why we need exactly 4 lenses to achieve this.\n\n3.0.2.1 Analysis of Different Lens Configurations\n1. Single Lens Configuration\nFor a single lens with focal length \\(f\\), the ABCD matrix is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{single} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThis clearly cannot match the free space matrix due to the non-zero \\(C\\) element.\n2. Two-Lens Configuration\nFor two lenses with focal lengths \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) separated by distance \\(d_{12}\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{two} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_2} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_{12} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhen \\(d_{12} = f_1 + f_2\\) (telescopic arrangement), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{two} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{f_1}{f_2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{f_2}{f_1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nSince both magnification (\\(A\\)) and angular magnification (\\(D\\)) cannot simultaneously equal 1 while maintaining \\(\\det(\\mathbf{M}) = 1\\), two lenses are insufficient.\n3. Three-Lens Configuration\nWith three lenses, we have more parameters but still need to determine if we can satisfy all constraints simultaneously. For a three-lens system with focal lengths \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), and \\(f_3\\), separated by distances \\(d_{12}\\) and \\(d_{23}\\), the system matrix would be:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{three} =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_3} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_{23} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_2} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_{12} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhen multiplied out, the focusing power (C element) of the system is:\n\\[C = -\\frac{1}{f_3} - \\frac{1}{f_2} - \\frac{1}{f_1} + \\frac{d_{12}}{f_1f_2} + \\frac{d_{23}}{f_2f_3} + \\frac{d_{12}d_{23}}{f_1f_2f_3}\\]\nThe magnification (A element) of the system is:\n\\[A = 1 - \\frac{d_{12}}{f_1} - \\frac{d_{23}}{f_2} + \\frac{d_{12}d_{23}}{f_1f_2}\\]\nFor perfect cloaking, we need both C = 0 and A = 1. From A = 1, we can derive:\n\\[\\frac{d_{12}}{f_1} + \\frac{d_{23}}{f_2} - \\frac{d_{12}d_{23}}{f_1f_2} = 0\\]\nSolving for \\(d_{23}\\), we get:\n\\[d_{23} = \\frac{d_{12}/f_1}{1/f_2 - d_{12}/(f_1f_2)}\\]\nSubstituting this into the condition for C = 0, we obtain a complex expression that places constraints on the possible values of \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), and \\(f_3\\). For typical lens configurations, this results in values that are difficult to realize physically, as it often requires either negative separations or negative focal lengths.\nWhile the three-lens system provides more parameters to work with than the two-lens system, the mathematical constraints of simultaneously achieving zero focusing power (C = 0) and unit magnification (A = 1) still make perfect cloaking challenging with conventional optical elements.\n4. Four-Lens Configuration: The Solution\nWe can arrange four lenses in two pairs:\n\nFirst pair (lenses 1 and 2): A beam compressor\nSecond pair (lenses 3 and 4): A beam expander\n\nFor the beam compressor, with lenses at their combined focal length apart:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{comp} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{f_1}{f_2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{f_2}{f_1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nSimilarly, for the beam expander:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{exp} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{f_3}{f_4} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{f_4}{f_3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThe combined system matrix is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{total} = \\mathbf{M}_{exp} \\times \\mathbf{M}_{comp} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{f_1}{f_2} \\times \\frac{f_3}{f_4} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{f_2}{f_1} \\times \\frac{f_4}{f_3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nFor perfect cloaking, we need: - \\(\\frac{f_1}{f_2} \\times \\frac{f_3}{f_4} = 1\\) - \\(\\frac{f_2}{f_1} \\times \\frac{f_4}{f_3} = 1\\)\nThis is satisfied when \\(f_1 = f_4\\) and \\(f_2 = f_3\\).\nWith the lenses properly spaced and an additional free space distance \\(d_0\\) between the two pairs, the complete system matrix becomes:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{cloaking} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhich perfectly mimics free space propagation, creating the optical cloaking effect.\n\n\nBeginnerHint [in figure.py]: Infinite field of view: cannot use limitObjectToFieldOfView=True.

Showing the default ObjectRays instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.0.3 Multifocal Imaging\nWe would like to explore the concept of multifocal imaging to obtain 3D resolution from a single image. In a microscope, an objective lens together with a tube lens is used to focus light from a sample onto a detector. Either the tube lens is no modified to shift the focal plane of the objective lens or one uses multiple tube lenses with different focal lengths with a single objective lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3— The multifocal adapter. (a) Composition of the multifocal imaging setup. The multifocal adapter (MFA) is inserted into the light path between a standard dark-field microscope and a camera. (b) Composition of the multifocal adapter. Incoming light from the microscope is infinity projected by the lens f1 and split by three consecutive beam-splitters (b1 = 25/75; b2 = 33/67; b3 = 50/50). Five mirrors (m) guide the light into four separate optical paths. The lens f5 projects the four images onto the camera chip. The inter-plane distance is set by lenses of different focal length (f1 - f4). (c, d) Experimentally acquired (c) and simulated (d) (see Methods) multifocal dark-field images (planes 1 - 4, 20x objective) of a calibration grid at the four focal positions (indicated on the left side), where one of the four focal planes maps the grid sharply. Scale bar represents 20 µm. Experiment was performed six times with similar results. Source\n\n\n\nIn the simplest configuration of an objective lens and a tube lens, the light first travels from the object to the objective lens in free space for a distance \\(s\\), which is represented by\n\n\n\\[\nM_1=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & s\\\\0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nThen it is passing the objective lens with\n\n\n\\[\nM_2=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\\\- \\frac{1}{f_{1}} & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\ntraveling further through free space with distance \\(d\\)\n\n\n\\[\nM_3=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & d\\\\0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nand then hitting the tube lens with\n\n\n\\[\nM_4=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\\\- \\frac{1}{\\Delta_{ft} + f_{t}} & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta_ft\\) is a parameter modifying the original tube lens focal distance \\(f_t\\). Finally, the light will propagate to the detector at distance \\(f_t\\) from the tube lens\n\n\n\\[\nM_s=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & f_{t}\\\\0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\ngicing for the whole system:\n\\[\nM_t=M_4 M_3 M_2 M_1\n\\]\nThe final matrix has again 4 parameters \\(A,B,C\\) and \\(D\\). For sharp imaging the parameter \\(B\\) of the system must be equal to zero, as the outgoing light should be independent of the incoming angle. This is achieved\n\n\n\\[\\delta s=\\frac{f_{1} \\left(\\Delta_{ft} d + \\Delta_{ft} f_{t} + f_{t}^{2}\\right)}{\\Delta_{ft} d - \\Delta_{ft} f_{1} + \\Delta_{ft} f_{t} + f_{t}^{2}}-s_0\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4— Plot of the solution with specific parameter values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe B Parameter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe B parameter is the most direct indicator of a sharp image in matrix optics. For an optical system with ABCD matrix: \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe output position is given by: \\[y_2 = Ay_1 + B\\theta_1\\]\nFor an image to be sharp, all rays originating from the same object point must converge to a single image point, regardless of their initial angles. This means that for a given \\(y_1\\) (object position), the final position \\(y_2\\) must be independent of the initial angle \\(\\theta_1\\).\nThis condition is satisfied when B = 0.\nWhen B = 0: - The final position depends only on the initial position (\\(y_2 = Ay_1\\)) - All rays from a point source converge to a single point in the image plane - The imaging is “stigmatic” (point-to-point mapping)\nIn our lens example, the system matrix was: \\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{system} =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1-\\frac{d}{f} & d \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nFor parallel input rays (different \\(y_1\\) but all \\(\\theta_1 = 0\\)), we needed A = 0 to make them all converge to a single point, which happened when d = f.\nBut for general imaging of points (not just parallel rays), the B = 0 condition is what determines whether the image is sharp. This is why, in optical design, finding conjugate planes (where B = 0) is essential for sharp imaging.",

The visible region, extending approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red), represents only a small fraction of this spectrum. This wave description is essential for understanding many optical phenomena that geometric optics cannot explain, particularly when dealing with structures comparable in size to the wavelength of light.\nIn the following, we would like to introduce wave by discarding the fact, that light is related to electric and magnetic fields. This is useful as the vectorial nature of the electric and magnetic field further complicates the calculations, but we do not need those yet.

Specifically, if \\(u_1(\\mathbf{r},t)\\) and \\(u_2(\\mathbf{r},t)\\) are solutions of the wave equation, then any linear combination:\n\\[\nu(\\mathbf{r},t)=a_1u_1(\\mathbf{r},t)+a_2u_2(\\mathbf{r},t)\n\\]\nis also a solution, where \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are arbitrary constants.\n\n\n4.1.2 Monochromatic Wave\nA monochromatic wave consists of a single frequency \\(\\omega\\). By definition, such a wave must be infinite in time and free from phase disturbances (such as sudden jumps). The mathematical expression for a monochromatic wave is:\n\\[u(\\mathbf{r},t)=a(\\mathbf{r})\\cos(\\omega t + \\phi(\\mathbf{r}))\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(a(\\mathbf{r})\\) represents the amplitude\n\\(\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\) represents the spatial phase\n\\(\\omega\\) represents the angular frequency\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2— Representation of a wavefunction over time (constant position) denoting the phase \\(\\phi\\) and the period \\(T=1/\\nu\\)\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2.1 Complex Amplitude\nThe wave can be represented in complex form as:\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r},t)=a(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}e^{i\\omega t}\n\\]\nThis is known as the complex wavefunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3— Phasor diagram of the complex amplitude \\(U(\\mathbf{r})\\) (left) and \\(U(t)\\) (right)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA phasor displays the complex amplitude with magnitude and phase as a vector in the complex plane.\n\n\nThe relationship between the complex and real wavefunctions is:\n\\[\nu(\\mathbf{r},t)=\\text{Re}\\{U(\\mathbf{r},t)\\}=\\frac{1}{2}[U(\\mathbf{r},t)+U^*(\\mathbf{r},t)]\n\\]\nThe complex wavefunction satisfies the same wave equation:\n\\[\n\\nabla^2 U - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2 U}{\\partial t^2}=0\n\\]\nWe can separate the complex wavefunction into spatial and temporal components:\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r},t)=U(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\omega t}\n\\]\nwhere\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r})=a(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\phi(\\mathbf{r})}\n\\]\nHere, \\(\\phi\\) represents the spatial phase of the wavefunction. Substituting this into the wave equation and noting that the time derivatives bring down factors of \\(i\\omega\\):\n\\[\\nabla^2 [U(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\omega t}] - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}[U(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\omega t}] = 0\\] \\[\\nabla^2 U(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\omega t} + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2}U(\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\omega t} = 0\\]\nThe time dependence \\(e^{i\\omega t}\\) factors out, leaving us with the Helmholtz equation:\n\\[\\nabla^2 U(\\mathbf{r}) + k^2U(\\mathbf{r}) = 0\\]\nwhere \\(k = \\omega/c\\) is the wave number. This equation describes the spatial behavior of monochromatic waves.\n\n\n4.1.2.2 Intensity of Waves\nThe intensity of a wave at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and time \\(t\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nI(\\mathbf{r},t)=2\\langle u^2(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rangle\n\\]\nwhere \\(I\\) is measured in units of \\(\\left[\\frac{W}{m^2}\\right]\\). The angle brackets \\(\\langle \\ldots \\rangle\\) represent a time average over one oscillation cycle of \\(u\\). For visible light, this averaging occurs over an extremely brief period - for example, light with a wavelength of 600 nm has a cycle duration of just 2 femtoseconds.\nThe optical power \\(P\\) of a wave can be calculated by integrating the intensity over a surface area \\(A\\):\n\\[\nP=\\int_A I(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, dA\n\\]\nInserting the seperation of the complex wavefunction into spatial and temporal components leads to the following expression for the intensity:\n\\[\nI(\\mathbf{r})=|U(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n\\]\nThus the physical quantity forming the spatial and temporal oscillation of the wavefunction is also providing the intensity of the wave when its magnitude is squared. This is a fundamental property of wavefunctions and for example not the case when temperature oscillates in space and time in a medium.\n\n\n4.1.2.3 Wavefronts\nWavefronts are surfaces in space where the phase is constant:\n\\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r})=\\text{const}\n\\]\nTypically, this constant is chosen to represent points of maximum spatial amplitude, such that:\n\\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r})=2\\pi q\n\\]\nwhere \\(q\\) is an integer.\nThe direction normal to these wavefronts can be described by the gradient vector:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{n}=\\nabla\\phi=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)\n\\]\nThis vector \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is always perpendicular to the wavefront surface and points in the direction of wave propagation. The evolution of these wavefronts in time provides important information about the wave’s propagation characteristics.",

    "title": "5  Interference in space and time",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Interference is a fundamental physical phenomenon that demonstrates the superposition principle for linear systems. This principle, which states that the net response to multiple stimuli is the sum of the individual responses, is central to our understanding of wave physics. Interference appears across many domains of physics: in optics where it enables high-precision measurements and holography, in quantum mechanics where it reveals the wave nature of matter, and in acoustics where it forms the basis for noise cancellation technology. The ability of waves to interfere constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively (canceling each other) has profound practical applications, from the anti-reflective coatings on optical elements to the operational principles of interferometric gravitational wave detectors like LIGO. Understanding interference is therefore not just of theoretical interest but crucial for modern technology and experimental physics.\nWhen two wave solutions \\(U_1(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(U_2(\\mathbf{r})\\) combine, their superposition gives:\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r})=U_1(\\mathbf{r})+U_2(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\nThe resulting intensity is:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\nI &= &|U|^2\\\\\n&= &|U_1+U_2|^2\\\\\n&= &|U_1|^2+|U_2|^2+U^{*}_1 U_2 + U_1 U^{*}_2\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nThe individual wave intensities are given by \\(I_1=|U_1|^2\\) and \\(I_2=|U_2|^2\\). Using this, we can express each complex wave amplitude in polar form, separating its magnitude (related to intensity) and phase:\n\\[\nU_1=\\sqrt{I_1}e^{i\\phi_1}\n\\] \\[\nU_2=\\sqrt{I_2}e^{i\\phi_2}\n\\]\nSubstituting these expressions back into our interference equation and performing the algebra, the total intensity becomes:\n\\[\nI=I_1+I_2+2\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\\cos(\\Delta \\phi)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_2-\\phi_1\\) is the phase difference between the waves. This equation is known as the interference formula and contains three terms:\n\n\\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\): the individual intensities\n\\(2\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\\cos(\\Delta \\phi)\\): the interference term that can be positive or negative\n\nA particularly important special case occurs when the interfering waves have equal intensities (\\(I_1=I_2=I_0\\)). The equation then simplifies to:\n\\[\nI=2I_0(1+\\cos(\\Delta \\phi))=4I_0\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nThis last form clearly shows that:\n\nMaximum intensity (\\(4I_0\\)) occurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi n\\) (constructive interference)\nZero intensity occurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi = (2n+1)\\pi\\) (destructive interference)\nThe intensity varies sinusoidally with the phase difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive Interference\n\n\n\nOccurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi m\\) (where \\(m\\) is an integer), resulting in \\(I=4I_0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive interference of two waves (top, middle) and the sum of the two wave amplitudes (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive Interference\n\n\n\nOccurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi=(2m-1)\\pi\\) (where \\(m\\) is an integer), resulting in \\(I=0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive interference of two waves (top, middle) and the sum of the two wave amplitudes (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.1 Phase and Path Difference\nThe phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) can be related to the path difference \\(\\Delta s\\) between the two waves. For two waves with the same frequency \\(\\omega\\), we can write their complete phase expressions as:\n\\[\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{k}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t + \\phi_{01}\\] \\[\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{k}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t + \\phi_{02}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{k}_i\\) are the wave vectors\n\\(\\mathbf{r}\\) is the position vector\n\\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency\n\\(\\phi_{0i}\\) are initial phase constants\n\nThe instantaneous phase difference is then:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\phi_2(\\mathbf{r},t) - \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = (\\mathbf{k}_2-\\mathbf{k}_1)\\cdot\\mathbf{r} + (\\phi_{02}-\\phi_{01})\n\\]\nFor stationary interference patterns, we typically observe the time-independent phase difference. When the waves travel along similar paths (same direction), this reduces to:\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = k\\Delta s + \\Delta\\phi_0\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta s\\) is the path difference and \\(\\Delta\\phi_0\\) is any initial phase difference between the sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase Difference and Path Difference\n\n\n\nA path difference \\(\\Delta s\\) corresponds to a phase difference \\(k\\Delta s=2\\pi\\Delta s/\\lambda\\). Path differences of integer multiples of \\(\\lambda\\) result in phase differences of integer multiples of \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Interference of Waves in Space\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference of two plane waves propagating under an angle of 45°. The two left graphs show the original waves. The two right show the total amplitude and the intensity pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference of a spherical wave and a plane wave. The top graphs show the original waves. The two bottom show the total amplitude and the intensity pattern.\n\n\n\n\nThe interference of the spherical and the plane wave (also the one of the two plane waves) give also an interesting result. The intensity resembles to be a snapshot of the shape of the wavefronts of the spherical wave. We can therefore measure the wavefronts of the spherical wave by interfering it with a plane wave. This is also the basic principle behind holography. There we use a reference wave to interfere with the wave that we want to measure. The interference pattern is recorded and can be used to reconstruct the wavefronts of the wave.\n\nA super nice website to try out interference interactively is here.\n\n\n\n5.0.3 Coherence\nIn the earlier consideration we obtained a general description for the phase difference between two waves. TIt is given by and contains the pathlength difference \\(\\Delta s\\) and some intrinsic phase \\(\\Delta\\phi_0\\) that could be part of the wave generation process.\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = k\\Delta s + \\Delta\\phi_0\\]\nTo observe stationary interference, it is important that these two quantities are also stationary, i.e. the phase relation between the two waves is stationary. This relation between the phase of two waves is called coherence and was assumed in all the examples before.\n\n\n\nTwo waves of different frequency over time.\n\n\nThe above image shows the timetrace of the amplitude of two wave with slightly different frequency. Due to the frequency, the waves run out of phase and have acquired a phase different of \\(\\pi\\) after \\(40\\) fs.\nThe temporal coherence of two waves is now defined by the time it takes for the two waves to obtain a phase difference of \\(2\\pi\\). The phase difference between two wave of frequency \\(\\nu_1\\) and \\(\\nu_2\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi (\\nu_2-\\nu_1)(t-t_0)\n\\]\nHere \\(t_0\\) refers to the time, when thw two waves were perfectly in sync. Lets assume that the two frequencies are seperarated from a central frequency \\(\\nu_0\\) such that\n\\[\n\\nu_1=\\nu_0-\\Delta \\nu/2\n\\] \\[\n\\nu_2=\\nu_0+\\Delta \\nu/2\n\\]\nInserting this into the first equation yields\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi \\Delta \\nu \\Delta t\n\\]\nwith \\(\\Delta t=t-t_0\\). We can now define the coherence time as the time interval over which the phase shift \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) grows to \\(2\\pi\\), i.e. \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi\\). The coherence time is thus\n\\[\n\\tau_{c}=\\Delta t =\\frac{1}{\\Delta \\nu}\n\\]\nThus the temporal coherence and the frequency distribution of the light are intrisincly connected. Monochromatic light has \\(\\Delta nu=0\\) and thus the coherence time is infinitely long. Light with a wide spectrum (white light for example) therefore has and extremly short coherence time.\nThe coherence time is also connected to a coherence length. The coherence length \\(L_c\\) is given by the distance light travels within the coherence time \\(\\tau_c\\), i.e.\n\\[\nL_c=c\\tau_c\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoherence\n\n\n\nTwo waves are called coherent, if they exihibit a fixed phase relation in space or time relation over time. It measures their ability to interfer. The main types of coherence are\n\n5.0.4 Temporal Coherence\n\nMeasures phase correlation of a wave with itself at different times\nCharacterized by coherence time \\(\\tau_c\\) and coherence length \\(L_c = c\\tau_c\\)\nRelated to spectral width: \\(\\tau_c = 1/\\Delta\\nu\\)\nPerfect for monochromatic waves (single frequency)\nLimited for broad spectrum sources (like thermal light)\n\n\n\n5.0.5 Spatial Coherence\n\nMeasures phase correlation between different points in space\nImportant for interference from extended sources\nDetermines ability to form interference patterns\nRelated to source size and geometry\n\nCoherence is a property of the light source and is connected to the frequency distribution of the light. Sources can be:\n\nFully coherent: ideal laser\nPartially coherent: real laser\nIncoherent: thermal light\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore General Description of Coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the above definition provides an intuitive picture based on frequency spread, we can describe coherence more rigorously using correlation functions. These functions measure how well a wave maintains its phase relationships:\nIn real physical systems, perfect coherence (constant phase relationship) between waves is rare. Partial coherence describes the degree to which waves maintain a consistent phase relationship over time and space. We can characterize this using correlation functions:\n\nTemporal Coherence The complex degree of temporal coherence is given by:\n\n\\[g^{(1)}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\langle U(t)U^*(t+\\tau)\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle|U(t)|^2\\rangle\\langle|U(t+\\tau)|^2\\rangle}}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\tau\\) is the time delay\n\\(U(t)\\) is the electric field\n\\(\\langle...\\rangle\\) denotes time averaging\n\n\nSpatial Coherence Similarly, spatial coherence between two points is characterized by:\n\n\\[g^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{\\langle U(\\mathbf{r}_1)U^*(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle|U(\\mathbf{r}_1)|^2\\rangle\\langle|U(\\mathbf{r}_2)|^2\\rangle}}\\]\nThe obtained correlation functions can be used to calculate the coherence time and length and have the following properties:\n\n\\(|g^{(1)}| = 1\\) indicates perfect coherence\n\\(|g^{(1)}| = 0\\) indicates complete incoherence\n\\(0 &lt; |g^{(1)}| &lt; 1\\) indicates partial coherence\n\nA finite coherence time and length is leads to partial coherence affects interference visibility through:\n\nReduced contrast in interference patterns\nLimited coherence length/area\nSpectral broadening\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal correlation for two waves with slightly different frequencies. The vertical line indicates the coherence time τc = π/Δω.\n\n\n\n\nBesides different frequencies the coherence time can also be affected by phase jumps. The following example shows two waves with the same frequency but multiple phase jumps. The temporal correlation function shows the decoherence due to the phase jumps.\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal correlation for two waves of same frequency showing decoherence due to multiple phase jumps. Vertical lines indicate positions of phase jumps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference\nSo far we looked at the interference of two waves, which was a simplification as I mentioned already earlier. Commonly there will be a multitude of partial waves contribute to the oberved intereference. This is what we would like to have a look at now. We will do that in a quite general fashion, as the resulting formulas will appear several times again for different problems.\nNevertheless we will make a difference between\n\nmultiwave interference of waves with the constant amplitude\nmultiwave interference of waves with decreasing amplitude\n\nEspecially the latter is often occuring, if we have multiple reflections and each reflection is only a fraction of the incident amplitude.\n\n\n5.0.6 Multiple Wave Interference with Constant Amplitude\nIn the case of constant amplitude (for example realized by a grating, which we talk about later), the total wave amplitude is given according to the picture below by\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_1+U_3+\\ldots+U_M\n\\]\nwhere we sum the amplitude over \\(M\\) partial waves. Between the neighboring waves (e.g. \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\)), we will assume a phase difference (because of a path length difference for example), which we denote as \\(\\Delta \\phi\\).\nThe amplitude of the p-th wave is then given by\n\\[\nU_p=\\sqrt{I_0}e^{i(p-1)\\Delta \\phi}\n\\]\nwith the index \\(p\\) being an interger \\(p=1,2,\\ldots,M\\), \\(h=e^{i\\Delta \\phi}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\) as the amplitude of each individual wave. The total amplitude \\(U\\) can be then expressed as\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\left (1+h+h^2+\\ldots +h^{M-1}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich is a geometric sum. We can apply the sum formula for geometric sums to obtain\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{1-h^M}{1-h}=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{1-e^{iM\\Delta \\phi}}{1-e^{i\\Delta \\phi}}\n\\]\nWe now have to calculate the intensity of the total amplitude\n\\[\nI=|U|^2=I_{0}\\left | \\frac{e^{-iM\\Delta \\phi/2}-e^{iM\\Delta \\phi/2}}{e^{-i\\Delta \\phi/2}-e^{i\\Delta \\phi/2}}\\right |^2\n\\]\nwhich we can further simplify to give\n\\[\nI=I_{0}\\frac{\\sin^2(M\\Delta \\phi/2)}{\\sin^2(\\Delta \\phi/2)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple wave interference of \\(M=6\\) waves with a phase difference of \\(\\phi=\\pi/8\\). The black arrows represent the individual waves, the red arrow the sum of all waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1— Multiple beam interference pattern for M=6 beams. The intensity distribution is shown as a function of the phase shift \\(\\phi\\). The first minimum is at \\(\\phi=2\\pi/M\\). The intensity distribution is symmetric around \\(\\phi=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is therefore an oscillating function. The numerator \\(\\sin^2(M\\Delta \\phi/2)\\) shows and oscillation frequency, which is by a factor of \\(M\\) higher than the one in the denominator \\(\\sin^2 (\\Delta \\phi/2)\\). Therefore the intensity pattern is oscillating rapidly and creating a first minimum at\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=\\frac{2\\pi}{M}\n\\]\nThis is an important result, since it shows that the number of sources \\(M\\) determines the position of the first minimum and the interference peak gets narrower with increasing \\(M\\). Since the phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) between neighboring sources is the same as for the double slit experiment, i.e. \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi d/\\lambda \\sin(\\theta)\\), we can also determine the angular position of the first minimum. This is given by\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_\\textrm{min})=\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\n\\]\nThis again has the common feature that it scales as \\(\\lambda/d\\). A special situation occurs, whenever the numerator and the denominator become zero. This will happen whenever\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=m 2\\pi\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is an integer and denotes the interference order, i.e. the number of wavelength that neighboring partial waves have as path length difference. In this case, the intensity distributiion will give us\n\\[\nI=I_0 \\frac{0}{0}\n\\]\nand we have to determine the limit with the help of l’Hospitals rule. The outcome of this calculation is, that\n\\[\nI(\\Delta \\phi=m2\\Delta \\pi)=M^2 I_0\n\\]\nwhich can be also realized when using the small angle approximation for the sine functions.\n\n5.0.6.1 Wavevector Representation\nWe would like to introduce a different representation of the multiple wave interference of the grating, which is quite insightful. The first order (\\(m=1\\)) constructive interference condition is given by\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sin{\\theta}= \\frac{1}{d}\n\\]\nwhich also means that\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\sin{\\theta}= \\frac{2\\pi}{d}\n\\]\nThis can be written as\n\\[\nk \\sin{\\theta}= K\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the magnitude of the wavevector of the light and \\(K\\) is the wavevector magnitude that corresponds to the grating period \\(d\\). As the magnitude of the wavevector of the light is conserved, the wavevectors of the incident light and the light traveling along the direction of the first interence peak form the sides of an equilateral triangle. This is shown in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nWavevector summation for the diffraction grating. The wavevector of the incident light \\(k\\) and the wavevector of the light traveling along the direction of the first interference peak \\(K\\) form an equilateral triangle.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the diffraction grating is providing a wavevector \\(K\\) to alter the direction of the incident light. This is again a common feature reappearing in many situations as for example in the X-ray diffraction of crystals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference with Decreasing Amplitude\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will turn our attention now to a slight modification of the previous multiwave interference. We will introduce a decreasing amplitude of the individual waves. The first wave shall have an amplitude \\(U_1=\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The next wave, however, will not only be phase shifted but also have a smaller amplitude.\n\\[\nU_2=h U_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(h=re^{i\\phi}\\) with \\(|h|=r&lt;1\\). \\(r\\) can be regarded as a reflection coefficient, which deminishes the amplitude of the incident wave. According to that the intensity is reduced by\n\\[\nI_2=|U_2|^2=|h U_1|^2=r^2 I_1\n\\]\nThe intensity of the incident wave is multiplied by a factor \\(r^2\\), while the amplitude is multiplied by \\(r\\). Note that the phase factor \\(e^{i\\Delta\\phi}\\) is removed when taking the square of this complex number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity at Boundaries\n\n\n\nThe amplitude of the reflected wave is diminished by a factor \\(r\\le 1\\), which is called the reflection coefficient. The intensity is diminished by a factor \\(R=|r|^2\\le1\\), which is the reflectance.\nIn the absence of absorption, reflectance \\(R\\) and transmittance \\(T\\) add to one due to energy conservation.\n\\[\nR+T=1\n\\]\n\n\nConsequently, the third wave would be now \\(U_3=hU_2=h^2U_1\\). The total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_3+\\ldots+U_M = \\sqrt{I_0}(1+h+h^2+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase construction of a multiwave intereference with M waves with decreasing amplitude due to a reflection coefficient \\(r=0.95\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple wave interference with decreasing amplitude. The graph shows the intensity distribution over the phase angle \\(\\phi\\) for different values of the Finesse \\(\\mathcal{F}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis yields again\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\frac{(1-h^M)}{1-h}=\\frac{\\sqrt{I_0}}{1-r e^{i\\Delta\\phi}}\n\\]\nCalculating the intensity of the waves is giving\n\\[\nI=|U|^2=\\frac{I_{0}}{|1-re^{i\\Delta\\phi}|^2}=\\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2+4r\\sin^2(\\Delta\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nwhich is also known as the Airy function. This function can be further simplified by the following abbrevations\n\\[\nI_{\\rm max}=\\frac{I_0}{(1-r)^2}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\n\\mathcal{F}=\\frac{\\pi \\sqrt{r}}{1-r}\n\\]\nwhere the latter is called the Finesse. With those abbrevations, we obtain\n\\[\nI=\\frac{I_{\\rm max}}{1+4\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{F}}{\\pi}\\right)^2\\sin^{2}(\\Delta\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nfor the interference of multiple waves with decreasing amplitude.\nThis intensity distribution has a different shape than the one we obtained for multiple waves with the same amplitude.\nWe clearly observe that with increasing Finesse the intensity maxima, which occur at multiples fo \\(\\pi\\) get much narrower. In addition the regions between the maxima show better contrast and fopr higher Finesse we get complete destructive interference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.7 Light beating\n\n5.0.7.1 Beating of two waves\nLet us consider now interference in the time domain. We introduce two monochromatic waves of frequencies \\(\\nu_1\\) and \\(\\nu_2\\). We will denote their amplitudes by \\(\\sqrt{I_1}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_2}\\).\nThe total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2 = \\sqrt{I_1} \\exp(i2\\pi\\nu_1 t) + \\sqrt{I_2} \\exp(i2\\pi\\nu_2 t)\n\\]\nsuch that we obtain an Intensity\n\\[\nI=|U|^2 = I_1 + I_2 + 2\\sqrt{I_1I_2}\\cos(2\\pi(\\nu_1-\\nu_2)t)\n\\]\nThe intensity is thus time dependent and oscillates at a frequency \\(\\nu_1-\\nu_2\\), which is the so-called beating frequency. Similar schemes are used in optical heterodyne detection but also in acoustics when tuning your guitar.\n\n\n5.0.7.2 Multiple wave beating and pulse generation\nConsider now a whole set of \\(M=2L+1\\) each with an amplitude \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The frequencies of the waves are given by \\(\\nu_q=\\nu_0+q\\Delta\\nu\\) with \\(q=-L,\\dots,L\\) with \\(\\nu_0\\) beeing the center frequency of the spectrum and \\(\\Delta \\nu\\) the frequency spacing. We will assume that \\(\\Delta nu&lt;&lt;\\nu_0\\) such that the total amplitude of the waves is given by\n\\[\nU=\\sum_{q=-L}^L \\sqrt{I_0} \\exp(i2\\pi(\\nu_0+q\\Delta\\nu)t)\n\\]\nThe total intensity can then be calculated in the same way as for the multiple source in space before. Using \\(\\phi=2\\pi \\Delta \\nu t\\) we obtained \\[\nI(t)=I_0 \\frac{\\sin^2(M\\pi t/T)}{\\sin^2(\\pi t/T)}\n\\]\nwith \\(T=1/\\Delta\\nu\\) and a maximum intensity of \\(I_{\\rm max}=M^2 I_0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2— Multiple wave beating with M=1000 monochromatic waves separated by Δν=1 GHz. The intensity oscillates with period T=1/Δν=1 ns. Each pulse has a width of approximately T/M=1 ps with maximum intensity I_max=M²I₀.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.8 Frequency Combs: Phase-Coherent Temporal Interference\nThe pulse generation we just examined leads us to an important concept in modern optics: frequency combs. A frequency comb is a spectrum consisting of a series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines that results from a train of phase-coherent pulses in the time domain.\n\n5.0.8.1 From Pulse Trains to Frequency Combs\nLet’s extend our understanding of multiple wave beating to include phase coherence. When we have a set of equidistant frequency components that maintain a fixed phase relationship, the resulting time-domain signal is a periodic train of pulses. Conversely, a periodic train of pulses in the time domain corresponds to a frequency comb in the spectral domain.\nThe relationship between these domains is described by the Fourier transform. For a pulse train with repetition rate \\(f_{rep} = \\Delta\\nu\\) (the spacing between frequency components), the frequency spectrum consists of lines at:\n\\[f_n = f_0 + n \\cdot f_{rep}\\]\nwhere \\(f_0\\) is the carrier-envelope offset frequency and \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\n\n5.0.8.2 Mathematical Description\nConsider a train of pulses described by the electric field:\n\\[E(t) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} A(t - m T_{rep}) e^{i[\\omega_c(t - m T_{rep}) + \\phi_{CE} \\cdot m + \\phi_0]}\\]\nwhere: - \\(A(t)\\) is the pulse envelope - \\(T_{rep} = 1/f_{rep}\\) is the pulse repetition period - \\(\\omega_c\\) is the carrier frequency - \\(\\phi_{CE}\\) is the carrier-envelope phase slip (the phase shift from pulse to pulse) - \\(\\phi_0\\) is a constant phase\nThe Fourier transform of this pulse train gives us a frequency comb with:\n\\[f_0 = \\frac{\\phi_{CE}}{2\\pi} \\cdot f_{rep}\\]\nThis carrier-envelope offset frequency (\\(f_0\\)) is crucial for determining the absolute positions of the comb lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3— Demonstration of a frequency comb. (Left) Time domain representation showing a train of phase-coherent pulses. (Right) Frequency domain representation showing equally spaced frequency lines forming a comb structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.8.3 Applications of Frequency Combs\nFrequency combs have revolutionized precision measurements in physics and enabled numerous applications:\n\nOptical Clocks: Frequency combs provide a “gear mechanism” to count optical frequencies, enabling optical atomic clocks that are orders of magnitude more precise than conventional atomic clocks.\nPrecision Spectroscopy: The precise and stable frequency references allow for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy.\nCalibration of Astronomical Spectrographs: Frequency combs enable the detection of Earth-like exoplanets by providing precise wavelength calibration for astronomical instruments.\nDistance Measurements: They enable precise absolute distance measurements used in applications from gravitational wave detectors to satellite formation flying.\nTelecommunications: Frequency combs can be used for wavelength-division multiplexing in optical communications.\n\n\n\n5.0.8.4 Connection to Mode-Locked Lasers\nIn practice, frequency combs are often generated using mode-locked lasers. In such lasers, multiple longitudinal modes of the laser cavity oscillate with a fixed phase relationship, resulting in short pulses. The Fourier transform of these regularly spaced pulses is precisely the frequency comb.\nThe mode-locking can be achieved through various mechanisms:\n\nActive mode-locking: Using an external modulator driven at the cavity round-trip frequency\nPassive mode-locking: Using saturable absorbers or Kerr-lens mode-locking\n\nThe 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Theodor W. Hänsch and John L. Hall for their contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique.\n\n\n5.0.8.5 The Fundamental Link Between Time and Frequency Domains\nFrequency combs beautifully illustrate the duality between time and frequency domains in physics. A perfectly periodic sequence of events in time (the pulse train) corresponds to discrete, equally spaced frequencies. The more precise and stable the temporal pattern, the more precise and stable the frequency components.\nThis duality is fundamental to many areas of physics and engineering, from quantum mechanics to signal processing, and frequency combs represent one of its most elegant and useful manifestations in optics.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In optics and laser physics, Gaussian beams represent one of the most fundamental and important mathematical descriptions of laser light propagation. They are particularly relevant for understanding laser resonators, optical systems, and coherent light behavior. This section introduces Gaussian beams from first principles and explores their mathematical description.\n\n6.0.1 Derivation from the Helmholtz Equation\nWe begin with the Helmholtz equation, which describes monochromatic electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous medium:\n\\[\\nabla^2 U + k^2 U = 0\\]\nwhere \\(U\\) represents the electric field component, \\(k = 2\\pi/\\lambda\\) is the wave number, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light. For a wave predominantly traveling along the \\(z\\)-axis, we can express the electric field as:\n\\[U(x,y,z) = u(x,y,z)e^{-ikz}\\]\nHere, \\(u(x,y,z)\\) is a complex amplitude function that varies slowly with \\(z\\) compared to the wavelength. Substituting this into the Helmholtz equation and expanding the Laplacian operator yields:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\right)(u e^{-ikz}) + k^2 (u e^{-ikz}) = 0\\]\nComputing the derivatives and simplifying:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} - 2ik\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0\\]\n\n\n6.0.2 The Paraxial Approximation\nThe paraxial approximation applies when the beam’s angular spread is small, meaning the wavefronts are nearly perpendicular to the propagation axis. Mathematically, this means that the amplitude \\(u\\) varies slowly along the propagation direction compared to transverse directions:\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\\right| \\ll \\left|2k\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right|\\]\nUnder this approximation, the Helmholtz equation simplifies to the paraxial Helmholtz equation:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} - 2ik\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0\\]\nTo solve this equation, we propose the ansatz:\n\\[u(x,y,z) = A(z)\\exp\\left[-\\frac{k}{2q(z)}(x^2 + y^2)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(A(z)\\) and \\(q(z)\\) are complex functions to be determined. Substituting this into the paraxial equation and solving the resulting differential equations:\n\\[\\frac{dq}{dz} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dA}{dz} = -\\frac{A}{q}\\]\nThese yield solutions \\(q(z) = q_0 + z\\) and \\(A(z) = \\frac{A_0}{q(z)}\\), where \\(q_0\\) and \\(A_0\\) are constants.\nThe complex beam parameter \\(q(z)\\) relates to physical parameters through:\n\\[\\frac{1}{q(z)} = \\frac{1}{R(z)} - i\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi w^2(z)}\\]\nwhere \\(R(z)\\) is the radius of curvature of the wavefront and \\(w(z)\\) is the beam radius at which the intensity falls to \\(1/e^2\\) of its axial value.\nSetting \\(q_0 = iz_0\\) where \\(z_0\\) is the Rayleigh range, we can express these parameters as:\n\\[w(z) = w_0\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)^2}\\]\n\\[R(z) = z\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{z_0}{z}\\right)^2\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(w_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda z_0}{\\pi}}\\) is the beam waist (minimum beam radius).\nThe complete Gaussian beam solution is:\n\\[U(x,y,z) = U_0 \\frac{w_0}{w(z)} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{w^2(z)}\\right] \\exp\\left[-ikz - ik\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2R(z)} + i\\phi(z)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi(z) = \\arctan(z/z_0)\\) is the Gouy phase shift, representing an additional phase beyond that of a plane wave.\nIn scalar wave theory, the intensity of the Gaussian beam is proportional to the square of the amplitude. It can be calculated as:\n\\[I(x,y,z) = |U(x,y,z)|^2 = I_0\\frac{w_0^2}{w^2(z)}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{2(x^2+y^2)}{w^2(z)}\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(I_0 = |U_0|^2\\) is the peak intensity at the beam waist. This expression shows that the intensity has a Gaussian profile in any transverse plane, with its peak on the beam axis. The intensity falls to \\(1/e^2\\) of its axial value at a radial distance \\(r = w(z)\\) from the axis, which defines the beam radius. The total power carried by the beam is conserved during propagation, but the peak intensity decreases as \\(w(z)\\) increases with distance from the waist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Gaussian Beam Propagation in the x-z Plane\n\n\n\nWe can visualize how a Gaussian beam’s intensity varies across both the propagation direction (z-axis) and transverse direction (x-axis) simultaneously using a 2D contour plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1— Gaussian Beam Intensity Distribution in the x-z Plane for a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a beam waist of \\(w_0=0.1\\, \\text{mm}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contour plot illustrates how the Gaussian beam intensity distribution evolves as it propagates. The horizontal axis represents the normalized propagation distance (z/z₀), while the vertical axis shows the normalized transverse distance (x/w₀). The color gradient indicates intensity values, with brighter colors representing higher intensities.\nThe white dashed lines trace the beam width w(z), where the intensity falls to 1/e² (approximately 13.5%) of its value on the beam axis. Note how the beam width reaches its minimum at the beam waist (z=0) and expands as the beam propagates away from the focus.\nThe plot clearly shows that the highest intensity occurs at the beam waist, with the intensity decreasing both as we move away from the center axis and as the beam propagates away from the focal point.\n\n\n\n6.0.2.1 Key Gaussian Beam Parameters\nThe following table summarizes the important parameters that characterize a Gaussian beam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nExpression\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBeam waist (\\(w_0\\))\n\nMinimum beam radius at focus (\\(z=0\\))\n\n\nBeam width (\\(w(z)\\))\n\\(w(z) = w_0\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)^2}\\)\nBeam radius at position \\(z\\)\n\n\nRayleigh length (\\(z_0\\))\n\\(z_0 = \\frac{\\pi w_0^2}{\\lambda}\\)\nDistance over which beam area doubles\n\n\nRadius of curvature (\\(R(z)\\))\n\\(R(z) = z\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{z_0}{z}\\right)^2\\right]\\)\nRadius of wavefront curvature\n\n\nDivergence angle (\\(\\theta\\))\n\\(\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi w_0}\\)\nFar-field half-angle of beam spread\n\n\nGouy phase (\\(\\phi(z)\\))\n\\(\\phi(z) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)\\)\nAdditional phase beyond plane wave\n\n\nComplex beam parameter (\\(q(z)\\))\n\\(q(z) = z + iz_0\\)\nCombined parameter for beam properties\n\n\n\nThese parameters are interrelated, forming a complete description of how a Gaussian beam propagates. The Rayleigh length \\(z_0\\) is particularly important as it defines the transition between the near field (where the beam is approximately collimated) and the far field (where the beam diverges linearly). At a distance of one Rayleigh length from the waist, the beam width increases by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and the intensity drops to half its maximum value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Gaussian Beam Intensity Profiles\n\n\n\nTo better understand the spatial distribution of intensity in a Gaussian beam, it’s helpful to visualize how the intensity varies along different directions. Here we explore two fundamental cross-sections: the axial intensity along the beam propagation path, and the transverse intensity profile at the beam waist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2— Gaussian Beam Intensity Profiles for a wavelenght of 632.8 nm and a beam waist of \\(w_0=0.1\\, m\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Gaussian Beam Propagation\n\n\n\nTo better understand the spatial evolution of a Gaussian beam as it propagates, we can visualize how two key parameters change with distance: the beam width \\(w(z)\\) and the wavefront radius of curvature \\(R(z)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3— Gaussian Beam Width and Wavefront Curvature for a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a beam waist of \\(w_0=0.1\\, \\text{mm}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left plot shows how the beam width \\(w(z)\\) evolves with distance from the beam waist. At \\(z = 0\\), the beam is at its narrowest point \\(w_0\\). At the Rayleigh range (\\(z = ±z_0\\)), the width increases to \\(\\sqrt{2}w_0\\). For \\(|z| \\gg z_0\\), the beam width increases approximately linearly with distance, corresponding to a constant far-field divergence angle \\(\\theta = \\lambda/(\\pi w_0)\\).\nThe right plot illustrates the wavefront radius of curvature \\(R(z)\\). At the beam waist, the wavefronts are flat (\\(R = \\infty\\)). The curvature reaches its minimum absolute value of \\(2z_0\\) at \\(z = ±z_0\\). For \\(z &gt; 0\\), \\(R(z)\\) is positive (converging wavefronts), while for \\(z &lt; 0\\), \\(R(z)\\) is negative (diverging wavefronts). As \\(|z|\\) increases, \\(R(z)\\) approaches the asymptotic behavior of a spherical wave, where \\(R(z) \\approx z\\).\nThese parameters together provide a complete description of how the Gaussian beam transforms from a tightly focused wave near the waist to an approximately spherical wave in the far field.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3 Gaussian Beam Transformation Through Optical Systems\n\n6.0.3.1 The ABCD Matrix Formalism\nThe propagation of Gaussian beams through optical systems can be elegantly described using the ABCD matrix formalism from ray optics. While ray optics typically tracks the position and angle of rays, for Gaussian beams we track the transformation of the complex beam parameter \\(q(z)\\).\nWhen a Gaussian beam passes through an optical system characterized by an ABCD matrix, the complex beam parameter transforms according to:\n\\[q_2 = \\frac{Aq_1 + B}{Cq_1 + D}\\]\nwhere \\(q_1\\) is the initial complex beam parameter and \\(q_2\\) is the transformed parameter. This remarkable result, known as the ABCD law for Gaussian beams, allows us to determine how the beam waist and wavefront curvature change through arbitrary optical systems.\n\n\n6.0.3.2 Common Optical Elements\nDifferent optical elements transform Gaussian beams in characteristic ways:\n\nFree-space propagation over distance \\(d\\) is represented by:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThis matrix describes how the beam naturally diverges as it propagates.\nThin lens with focal length \\(f\\):\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1/f & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nA lens modifies the wavefront curvature without changing the beam diameter at the lens location.\nCurved interface between media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) and radius of curvature \\(R\\):\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R} & \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nMultiple optical elements can be analyzed by multiplying their respective ABCD matrices in the order encountered by the beam.\n\n\n6.0.3.3 Focusing of Gaussian Beams\nA particularly important case is the focusing of a Gaussian beam by a lens. If a collimated Gaussian beam with waist \\(w_0\\) is incident on a lens with focal length \\(f\\), the focused beam will have a new waist:\n\\[w_0' = \\frac{\\lambda f}{\\pi w_0}\\]\nlocated approximately at the focal point. This equation highlights the fundamental diffraction limit of focusing: smaller focal spots require larger input beam diameters relative to the wavelength.\nThe transformation matrices enable us to design optical systems that reshape Gaussian beams to desired specifications—expanding, collimating, or focusing them for specific applications. This matrix approach bridges ray optics and wave optics, providing a powerful tool for optical system design with coherent light sources.\n\n\n\n6.0.4 Higher-Order Gaussian Modes\n\n6.0.4.1 Hermite-Gaussian Beams\nHermite-Gaussian modes form a complete set of solutions to the paraxial wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. They can be expressed as:\n\\[U_{nm}(x,y,z) = U_0\\frac{w_0}{w(z)}H_n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}x}{w(z)}\\right)H_m\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}y}{w(z)}\\right) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{w^2(z)}\\right]\\] \\[\\times \\exp\\left[-ikz - ik\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2R(z)} + i(n+m+1)\\phi(z)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(H_n\\) and \\(H_m\\) are Hermite polynomials of orders \\(n\\) and \\(m\\). The indices \\(n,m = 0,1,2,...\\) determine the number of nodes in the intensity pattern along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions. The fundamental Gaussian beam corresponds to \\(n=m=0\\).\nThese modes naturally arise in laser resonators with rectangular symmetry and maintain their intensity pattern during propagation, though they scale in size. Each higher-order mode experiences an additional Gouy phase shift, causing different modes to accumulate phase at different rates during propagation.\n\n\n6.0.4.2 Laguerre-Gaussian Beams\nIn systems with cylindrical symmetry, Laguerre-Gaussian modes provide a more natural description. In cylindrical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,z)\\), they are given by:\n\\[U_{pl}(r,\\theta,z) = U_0\\frac{w_0}{w(z)}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}r}{w(z)}\\right)^{|l|}L_p^{|l|}\\left(\\frac{2r^2}{w^2(z)}\\right) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{r^2}{w^2(z)}\\right]\\] \\[\\times \\exp\\left[-ikz - ik\\frac{r^2}{2R(z)} + i(2p+|l|+1)\\phi(z) + il\\theta\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(L_p^{|l|}\\) are the associated Laguerre polynomials, \\(p \\geq 0\\) is the radial index determining the number of radial nodes, and \\(l\\) is the azimuthal index that determines the helical structure of the wavefront.\nA remarkable property of Laguerre-Gaussian modes with \\(l \\neq 0\\) is that they carry orbital angular momentum of \\(l\\hbar\\) per photon. The intensity distribution forms a ring-like pattern with a dark center for \\(l \\neq 0\\) due to the phase singularity along the beam axis. As \\(p\\) increases, additional concentric rings appear in the intensity pattern.\nBoth families of higher-order modes are important in modern optics applications, including optical manipulation, quantum information processing, and mode-division multiplexing in optical communications. They represent different orthogonal bases of the same solution space and can be transformed into each other through appropriate optical systems.",

    "text": "7.1.1 1.1 Random Photon Streams and Poisson Statistics\n\n7.1.1.1 Photon Streams and Time Bins\nTo understand photon statistics, we first need to conceptualize light as a stream of discrete photons arriving at a detector over time. Let’s develop a model where we divide our total observation time \\(T\\) into \\(M\\) equal time bins, each of duration \\(\\Delta t = T/M\\).\nFor a light source with average intensity \\(I\\), the average number of photons expected in the entire observation period is \\(\\bar{n} = \\alpha T\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is proportional to the intensity. The average number of photons per time bin is therefore \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M = \\alpha \\Delta t\\).\nIn a random photon stream, the arrival of each photon is an independent event with no memory of previous arrivals. This means that for small enough time bins, each bin has: - A probability \\(p = \\mu\\) of containing exactly one photon - A probability \\(1-p\\) of containing no photons - A negligible probability of containing more than one photon (for sufficiently small \\(\\Delta t\\))\n\n\n7.1.1.2 From Time Bins to Binomial Distribution\nGiven these properties, we can calculate the probability \\(P(n,M)\\) of detecting exactly \\(n\\) photons in \\(M\\) time bins. This is equivalent to asking: what is the probability of having exactly \\(n\\) successes in \\(M\\) independent trials, where the probability of success in each trial is \\(p = \\mu\\)?\nThis is precisely the binomial distribution:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} p^n (1-p)^{M-n} = \\binom{M}{n} \\mu^n (1-\\mu)^{M-n}\\]\nwhere \\(\\binom{M}{n} = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!}\\) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) time bins from \\(M\\) total bins.\n\n\n7.1.1.3 The Poisson Limit\nNow, let’s consider what happens as we make our time bins smaller and more numerous. In the limit where \\(M \\to \\infty\\) and \\(\\Delta t \\to 0\\), while keeping the total observation time \\(T\\) and the average photon number \\(\\bar{n}\\) constant:\n\nThe number of bins \\(M\\) increases\nThe probability per bin \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M\\) decreases\nThe product \\(M\\mu = \\bar{n}\\) remains constant\n\nIn this limit, the binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution. To see this, we substitute \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M\\) into the binomial formula:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^n \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{M^n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}\\]\nAs \\(M \\to \\infty\\), we can use the following approximations:\n\\[\\frac{M!}{(M-n)!M^n} \\approx 1\\]\nfor large \\(M\\) and fixed \\(n\\), and:\n\\[\\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n} \\approx \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^M \\approx e^{-\\bar{n}}\\]\napplying the limit definition of the exponential function.\nThis gives us the Poisson distribution:\n\\[P(n) = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} P(n,M) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n e^{-\\bar{n}}}{n!}\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{n}\\) is the mean photon number in the interval.\n\n\n7.1.1.4 Properties of the Poisson Distribution\nThe Poisson distribution has the remarkable property that its variance equals its mean:\n\\[\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle = \\bar{n}\\]\nThis equal mean and variance is a signature of the randomness in the photon arrival process, where events occur independently and at a constant average rate.\nTo verify this property, we can calculate the mean and variance directly from the probability distribution:\nThe mean: \\(\\langle n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P(n) = \\bar{n}\\)\nThe variance: \\(\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n-\\bar{n})^2 P(n) = \\bar{n}\\)\n\n\n7.1.1.5 Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Random Light\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a crucial metric in experimental physics, quantifying our ability to distinguish a signal from the background noise. For a measurement, the SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean signal to the standard deviation of the noise:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{signal}}{\\text{noise}} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}\\]\nFor random light following Poisson statistics, we have:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}} = \\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\]\nThis relationship reveals an important property of random light: the SNR scales as the square root of the mean photon number. This is known as the “shot noise limit” and represents a fundamental quantum limit to measurement precision with coherent light. To improve the SNR by a factor of 2, we need to increase the light intensity (or integration time) by a factor of 4.\nThis \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\) scaling of SNR is a direct consequence of the statistical independence of photon arrivals in coherent light and plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity limits of optical measurements, from astronomical observations to laser-based communications.\nThis statistical behavior is characteristic of coherent light sources such as ideal lasers, where photon emission events are independent of each other.\n\n\n\n7.1.2 1.2 Beam Splitters and Photon Statistics\nA beam splitter is an optical component that splits an incident beam into two parts. For a 50:50 beam splitter, an incoming photon has equal probability of being transmitted or reflected. Interestingly, when random (Poissonian) light is incident on a beam splitter, the statistics of the output beams remain Poissonian.\nTo understand why, consider that each photon in the input beam makes an independent decision to be transmitted or reflected. If the input beam has Poisson statistics with mean \\(\\bar{n}\\), the transmitted beam will have a mean of \\(\\bar{n}_T = R\\bar{n}\\) and the reflected beam will have a mean of \\(\\bar{n}_R = T\\bar{n}\\), where \\(R\\) and \\(T\\) are the reflection and transmission coefficients (\\(R + T = 1\\)).\nThe independence of photon behavior ensures that both output beams maintain Poisson statistics, just with scaled means. This is mathematically represented as:\n\\[P_T(n_T) = \\frac{(R\\bar{n})^{n_T} e^{-R\\bar{n}}}{n_T!}\\]\n\\[P_R(n_R) = \\frac{(T\\bar{n})^{n_R} e^{-T\\bar{n}}}{n_R!}\\]\nThis preservation of statistics is a direct consequence of the binomial sampling of the original Poisson distribution, which yields another Poisson distribution.\n\n\n7.1.3 1.3 Thermal Light and Exponential Statistics\nThermal light, such as that emitted by incandescent bulbs or stars, exhibits different statistical properties. The emission process in thermal sources involves atoms transitioning between energy levels due to thermal excitation. This process leads to what we call “bunching” of photons.\nFor thermal light, the probability distribution of photons follows:\n\\[P(n) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{(1+\\bar{n})^{n+1}}\\]\nThis distribution results in a variance that exceeds the mean:\n\\[\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle + \\langle n \\rangle^2 = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2\\]\nThe photon number fluctuations are larger than in coherent light, reflecting the bunching tendency of thermal photons. This bunching arises from the Bose-Einstein statistics governing photons, which encourages multiple photons to occupy the same mode.\nThe intensity fluctuations of thermal light follow an exponential distribution:\n\\[P(I) = \\frac{1}{\\langle I \\rangle} e^{-I/\\langle I \\rangle}\\]\nThis exponential behavior is a direct consequence of the random nature of thermal emission processes, where the radiation field is built up from the contributions of many independent atomic emitters.\n\n7.1.3.1 Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Thermal Light\nThe signal-to-noise ratio for thermal light differs significantly from that of coherent light due to the different statistical distribution of photons. Using the definition of SNR as the ratio of mean signal to the standard deviation of noise:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}\\]\nFor thermal light, with \\(\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2\\), we have:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2}} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\bar{n}} + 1}}\\]\nIn the limit of large photon numbers (\\(\\bar{n} \\gg 1\\)), which is common for thermal light sources, this simplifies to:\n\\[\\text{SNR} \\approx \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}} = 1\\]\nThis is a striking result: for thermal light at high intensities, the SNR approaches a constant value of 1, regardless of how much we increase the intensity. This is in stark contrast to the coherent light case where SNR increases as \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\).\nThis fundamental limitation on the SNR of thermal light is due to the inherent “excess noise” from photon bunching. It explains why many precision optical measurements preferentially use laser sources (with Poisson statistics) rather than thermal sources, even when high intensities are available.\nThe comparison between thermal light (SNR ~ 1) and coherent light (SNR ~ \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\)) provides a clear example of how the quantum statistical properties of a light source directly impact measurement sensitivity in practical applications.",

From Classical Fields to Quantum Optics\n\n7.2.1 2.1 Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field\nTo transition from classical optics to quantum optics, we need to quantize the electromagnetic field. We start with Maxwell’s equations in vacuum and consider a single mode of the field in a cavity of volume \\(V\\).\nThe classical electric and magnetic fields for a mode with wavevector \\(\\vec{k}\\) and polarization \\(\\vec{\\epsilon}\\) can be written as:\n\\[\\vec{E}(\\vec{r},t) = E_0(a(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\] \\[\\vec{B}(\\vec{r},t) = B_0(a(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\]\nwhere \\(E_0\\) and \\(B_0\\) are constants, and \\(a(t)\\) and \\(a^*(t)\\) are complex amplitudes.\nThe energy of this field is:\n\\[H = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_V (\\epsilon_0 E^2 + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}B^2)d^3r = \\hbar\\omega(a^*a + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nObserve that this has the same form as the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator.

    "text": "7.3 3. Photon Entanglement on a Beam Splitter\n\n7.3.1 3.1 Quantum Operator Approach to Entanglement\nOne of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum optics is the creation of entangled photon states. A beam splitter, beyond its classical role, can actually generate quantum entanglement under specific conditions.\nConsider a situation where two identical photons simultaneously enter a 50:50 beam splitter from different input ports. Quantum mechanically, we denote the creation operators for the input ports as \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{b}^\\dagger\\), and for the output ports as \\(\\hat{c}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{d}^\\dagger\\).\nThe beam splitter transformation can be written as:\n\\[\\hat{c}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{d}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\]\nThe initial state with one photon in each input port is \\(|1_a, 1_b\\rangle = \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle\\). After passing through the beam splitter, this state becomes:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{c}^\\dagger + \\hat{d}^\\dagger)(\\hat{c}^\\dagger - \\hat{d}^\\dagger)|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}((\\hat{c}^\\dagger)^2 - (\\hat{d}^\\dagger)^2)|0\\rangle\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_c, 0_d\\rangle - |0_c, 2_d\\rangle)\\]\nThis is an entangled state where either both photons exit through port \\(c\\) or both exit through port \\(d\\), with no possibility of one photon in each output port. This phenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is a direct manifestation of quantum interference and photon indistinguishability.\nThe entanglement is evident because the state cannot be factorized into a product of states for the two output modes. This non-classical correlation is a resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols.\n\n\n7.3.2 3.2 Probability Amplitude Approach to Entanglement\nWe can also understand photon entanglement through the language of probability amplitudes and phase factors, which may be more intuitive for visualizing what happens at a beam splitter.\nWhen a single photon encounters a beam splitter, there are two possible outcomes: reflection or transmission. In quantum mechanics, we associate probability amplitudes with each outcome:\n\nFor reflection: amplitude \\(r = \\sqrt{R}e^{i\\phi_r}\\), where \\(R\\) is the reflection probability and \\(\\phi_r\\) is a phase factor\nFor transmission: amplitude \\(t = \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\phi_t}\\), where \\(T\\) is the transmission probability and \\(\\phi_t\\) is a phase factor\n\nFor a 50:50 beam splitter, \\(R = T = 1/2\\). Importantly, the phase relationship between reflection and transmission must satisfy \\(\\phi_r - \\phi_t = \\pi/2\\) for energy conservation, which is typically implemented as \\(r = 1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(t = i/\\sqrt{2}\\), where the imaginary unit \\(i\\) represents a 90u00b0 phase shift.\nNow, consider two photons entering the beam splitter from different input ports (let’s call them 1 and 2). There are four possible outcomes:\n\nBoth photons are reflected: Amplitude = \\(r_1 r_2 = 1/2\\)\nBoth photons are transmitted: Amplitude = \\(t_1 t_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})^2 = i^2/2 = -1/2\\)\nPhoton 1 reflected, Photon 2 transmitted: Amplitude = \\(r_1 t_2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})(i/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\nPhoton 1 transmitted, Photon 2 reflected: Amplitude = \\(t_1 r_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\n\nThe key insight comes when we consider the output ports (let’s call them 3 and 4). For both photons to exit through port 3, either both must be reflected or both must be transmitted. The combined amplitude is:\n\\[A_{both~in~3} = r_1 r_2 + t_1 t_2 = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\\]\nSimilarly, for both photons to exit through port 4:\n\\[A_{both~in~4} = t_1 r_2 + r_1 t_2 = i/2 + i/2 = i\\]\nFor one photon in each output port, the amplitude is zero due to destructive interference.\nSquaring these amplitudes to get probabilities:\n\nProbability of both photons in port 3: \\(|0|^2 = 0\\)\nProbability of both photons in port 4: \\(|i|^2 = 1\\)\nProbability of one photon in each port: \\(0\\)\n\nThis means the photons always exit together through the same port (in this case, port 4), never one in each port. The two photons are now entangled - they behave as a single entity rather than two independent particles.\nIf we adjust our phase convention slightly to maintain symmetry between the ports, we get the state:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_3, 0_4\\rangle - |0_3, 2_4\\rangle)\\]\nwhich matches our result from the operator formalism.\nThis phase-dependent quantum interference demonstrates how the simple process of reflection and transmission, combined with the wave nature of quantum particles, leads to complex phenomena like entanglement. The phase factors are crucial - without the \\(\\pi/2\\) phase difference between reflection and transmission, this entanglement would not occur.",
