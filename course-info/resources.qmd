I will refer in the lecture to several resources from which I have listed here some useful books. The most comprehensive one is Fundamentals of Photonics by Saleh and Teich.

- Fundamentals of Photonics, Saleh/Teich
- Optics, Hecht
- Classical Electrodynamics, Jackson
- [Introduction to Fourier Optics, Goodman](https://archive.org/details/GoodmanFourierOptics/mode/2up)
- Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics, Mandel/Wolf
- Nonlinear Optics, Bloembergen
- Nonlinear Optics, Boyd
- Plasmonics: Fundamentals and Applications, Maier
- Principles of Nano-Optics, Hecht/Nowotny



Besides that, the field of photonics is full of interesting research articles that will appear here as we go:
