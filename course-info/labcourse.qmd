title: "Lab Course"
---

At the end of the course, we will conduct a block lab course where students will have the opportunity to apply the principles of Fourier Optics in a hands-on setting. Students should form groups of 4-5 people, and each group will be allocated two days for experimentation.

The lab course is designed to promote free experimentation. Each group will:

- On the first day: Brainstorm and develop ideas for experiments using the provided optical equipment, start with experiments
- On the second day: Carry out the planned experiments and write up the results in the afternoon

We will provide a set of optical equipment for each group to explore concepts from Fourier Optics in a practical way. Possible dates for the lab course will be published in the second half of the semester. A sign-up form will be made available for registration.
