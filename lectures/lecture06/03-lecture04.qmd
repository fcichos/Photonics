## From Classical Fields to Quantum Optics

### Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field

To transition from classical optics to quantum optics, we need to quantize the electromagnetic field. We start with Maxwell's equations in vacuum and consider a single mode of the field in a cavity of volume $V$.

The classical electric and magnetic fields for a mode with wavevector $\vec{k}$ and polarization $\vec{\epsilon}$ can be written as:

$$\vec{E}(\vec{r},t) = E_0(a(t)\vec{\epsilon}e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}} + a^*(t)\vec{\epsilon}^*e^{-i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}})$$
$$\vec{B}(\vec{r},t) = B_0(a(t)(\vec{k}\times\vec{\epsilon})e^{i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}} + a^*(t)(\vec{k}\times\vec{\epsilon})^*e^{-i\vec{k}\cdot\vec{r}})$$

where $E_0$ and $B_0$ are constants, and $a(t)$ and $a^*(t)$ are complex amplitudes.

The energy of this field is:

$$H = \frac{1}{2}\int_V (\epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{\mu_0}B^2)d^3r = \hbar\omega(a^*a + \frac{1}{2})$$

Observe that this has the same form as the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator. This suggests replacing the complex amplitudes $a$ and $a^*$ with operators $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ that satisfy the commutation relation:

$$[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] = 1$$

The Hamiltonian then becomes:

$$\hat{H} = \hbar\omega(\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a} + \frac{1}{2})$$

This is precisely the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator, where $\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}$ is the number operator $\hat{n}$ that counts the number of photons in the mode.

### Photon States and Quadrature Components

The energy eigenstates of this quantum harmonic oscillator are the Fock states $|n\rangle$, which represent states with exactly $n$ photons. The action of the creation and annihilation operators on these states is:

$$\hat{a}^\dagger|n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle$$
$$\hat{a}|n\rangle = \sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle$$

Just as in a mechanical harmonic oscillator with position $x$ and momentum $p$, we can define quadrature components for the quantized electromagnetic field:

$$\hat{X} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger)$$
$$\hat{P} = \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a})$$

These operators are analogous to the position and momentum operators of a mechanical oscillator and satisfy the commutation relation:

$$[\hat{X}, \hat{P}] = i$$

The physical interpretation of these quadratures becomes clear when we look at the expectation value of the electric field operator in a coherent state $|\alpha\rangle$ (which is the quantum state that most closely resembles a classical electromagnetic wave):

$$\langle\alpha|\hat{E}(\vec{r},t)|\alpha\rangle \propto \langle\alpha|(\hat{a}e^{-i\omega t} + \hat{a}^\dagger e^{i\omega t})|\alpha\rangle = 2|\alpha|\cos(\omega t - \phi)$$

where $\alpha = |\alpha|e^{i\phi}$.

We can see that $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{P}$ correspond to the amplitude and phase quadratures of the field, respectively. They are the quantum analogs of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of a classical electromagnetic wave.

The uncertainty principle for these quadratures,

$$\Delta X \cdot \Delta P \geq \frac{1}{2}$$

implies fundamental limits on our ability to simultaneously determine both quadratures with arbitrary precision. This leads to interesting quantum states of light such as squeezed states, where the uncertainty in one quadrature is reduced below the standard quantum limit at the expense of increased uncertainty in the conjugate quadrature.

## Photon Entanglement on a Beam Splitter

### Quantum Operator Approach to Entanglement

One of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum optics is the creation of entangled photon states. A beam splitter, beyond its classical role, can actually generate quantum entanglement under specific conditions.

Consider a situation where two identical photons simultaneously enter a 50:50 beam splitter from different input ports. Quantum mechanically, we denote the creation operators for the input ports as $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{b}^\dagger$, and for the output ports as $\hat{c}^\dagger$ and $\hat{d}^\dagger$.

The beam splitter transformation can be written as:

$$\hat{c}^\dagger = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{b}^\dagger)$$
$$\hat{d}^\dagger = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{b}^\dagger)$$

The initial state with one photon in each input port is $|1_a, 1_b\rangle = \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{b}^\dagger |0\rangle$. After passing through the beam splitter, this state becomes:

$$\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{b}^\dagger |0\rangle \rightarrow \frac{1}{2}(\hat{c}^\dagger + \hat{d}^\dagger)(\hat{c}^\dagger - \hat{d}^\dagger)|0\rangle = \frac{1}{2}((\hat{c}^\dagger)^2 - (\hat{d}^\dagger)^2)|0\rangle$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|2_c, 0_d\rangle - |0_c, 2_d\rangle)$$

This is an entangled state where either both photons exit through port $c$ or both exit through port $d$, with no possibility of one photon in each output port. This phenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is a direct manifestation of quantum interference and photon indistinguishability.

The entanglement is evident because the state cannot be factorized into a product of states for the two output modes. This non-classical correlation is a resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols.

### Probability Amplitude Approach to Entanglement

We can also understand photon entanglement through the language of probability amplitudes and phase factors, which may be more intuitive for visualizing what happens at a beam splitter.

When a single photon encounters a beam splitter, there are two possible outcomes: reflection or transmission. In quantum mechanics, we associate probability amplitudes with each outcome:

- For reflection: amplitude $r = \sqrt{R}e^{i\phi_r}$, where $R$ is the reflection probability and $\phi_r$ is a phase factor
- For transmission: amplitude $t = \sqrt{T}e^{i\phi_t}$, where $T$ is the transmission probability and $\phi_t$ is a phase factor

For a 50:50 beam splitter, $R = T = 1/2$. Importantly, the phase relationship between reflection and transmission must satisfy $\phi_r - \phi_t = \pi/2$ for energy conservation, which is typically implemented as $r = 1/\sqrt{2}$ and $t = i/\sqrt{2}$, where the imaginary unit $i$ represents a 90u00b0 phase shift.

Now, consider two photons entering the beam splitter from different input ports (let's call them 1 and 2). There are four possible outcomes:

1. Both photons are reflected: Amplitude = $r_1 r_2 = 1/2$
2. Both photons are transmitted: Amplitude = $t_1 t_2 = (i/\sqrt{2})^2 = i^2/2 = -1/2$
3. Photon 1 reflected, Photon 2 transmitted: Amplitude = $r_1 t_2 = (1/\sqrt{2})(i/\sqrt{2}) = i/2$
4. Photon 1 transmitted, Photon 2 reflected: Amplitude = $t_1 r_2 = (i/\sqrt{2})(1/\sqrt{2}) = i/2$

The key insight comes when we consider the output ports (let's call them 3 and 4). For both photons to exit through port 3, either both must be reflected or both must be transmitted. The combined amplitude is:

$$A_{both~in~3} = r_1 r_2 + t_1 t_2 = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0$$

Similarly, for both photons to exit through port 4:

$$A_{both~in~4} = t_1 r_2 + r_1 t_2 = i/2 + i/2 = i$$

For one photon in each output port, the amplitude is zero due to destructive interference.

Squaring these amplitudes to get probabilities:

- Probability of both photons in port 3: $|0|^2 = 0$
- Probability of both photons in port 4: $|i|^2 = 1$
- Probability of one photon in each port: $0$

This means the photons always exit together through the same port (in this case, port 4), never one in each port. The two photons are now entangled - they behave as a single entity rather than two independent particles.

If we adjust our phase convention slightly to maintain symmetry between the ports, we get the state:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|2_3, 0_4\rangle - |0_3, 2_4\rangle)$$

which matches our result from the operator formalism.

This phase-dependent quantum interference demonstrates how the simple process of reflection and transmission, combined with the wave nature of quantum particles, leads to complex phenomena like entanglement. The phase factors are crucial - without the $\pi/2$ phase difference between reflection and transmission, this entanglement would not occur.

## Conclusion

This introduction has taken us from the statistical nature of photons to the quantum description of the electromagnetic field. We've seen how random photon streams lead to Poisson statistics, how beam splitters interact with these statistics, and how thermal light exhibits exponential intensity distribution due to the bunching of photons.

We've also established the connection between Maxwell's equations and the quantum harmonic oscillator, introducing the concept of photon number states and field quadratures. Finally, we've explored how beam splitters can create quantum entanglement between photons, demonstrating the non-classical nature of light.

These foundations of quantum optics open the door to a rich field of study, including quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication, where the quantum properties of light are harnessed for technological applications beyond the capabilities of classical systems.
