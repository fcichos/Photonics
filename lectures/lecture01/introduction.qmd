## Fundamental Physical Limitations of Electronics

- **RC Time Constants**: As circuit dimensions shrink, the RC time constant doesn't scale favorably, creating a fundamental speed limit for electronic signal propagation.
- **Joule Heating**: Current flow through resistive elements produces heat proportional to I²R, which becomes increasingly problematic as device density increases according to Moore's Law.
- **Skin Effect**: At high frequencies, current flows primarily near conductor surfaces due to electromagnetic field penetration limitations, increasing effective resistance.
- **Electromagnetic Interference**: Current-carrying wires act as both transmitters and receivers of electromagnetic radiation, creating cross-talk issues that worsen with frequency.

## Advantages from Maxwell's Equations Perspective

- **Photon vs. Electron Energy**: Photons at optical frequencies (~10^14 Hz) have energies of ~1-2 eV, while electronic transitions in semiconductors operate at much lower energies, enabling fundamentally higher information bandwidth.
- **Wave-Particle Nature**: Light's dual nature allows it to be guided, focused, and manipulated without the scattering mechanisms that limit electron transport in solids.
- **Dispersion Relations**: The dispersion relation for photons in waveguides can be engineered more flexibly than electronic band structures in semiconductors.

## Quantitative Comparisons

- **Information Capacity**: According to Shannon's theorem, channel capacity increases linearly with bandwidth. Optical frequencies (~100 THz) offer approximately 10,000 times more bandwidth than the highest practical electronic frequencies (~10 GHz).
- **Propagation Losses**: Modern optical fibers achieve losses of ~0.2 dB/km, while electronic transmission lines typically experience losses of 10-100 dB/km at high frequencies.
- **Energy Per Bit**: Theoretical minimum energy to transmit one bit optically is orders of magnitude lower than electronic transmission (~10^-18 J vs ~10^-15 J).

## Quantum Mechanical Considerations

- **Coherence Properties**: Photons maintain quantum coherence over much longer distances than electrons in solid-state environments, enabling quantum information applications.
- **Non-interacting Bosons**: Unlike electrons (fermions), photons don't directly interact with each other, allowing signals to cross without interference.
