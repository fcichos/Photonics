However, at the quantum level, light consists of discrete energy packets called photons. The statistical distribution of these photons provides profound insights into the nature of light sources.\n\n### Random Photon Streams and Poisson Statistics\n\n#### Photon Streams and Time Bins\n\nTo understand photon statistics, we first need to conceptualize light as a stream of discrete photons arriving at a detector over time. Let's develop a model where we divide our total observation time $T$ into $M$ equal time bins, each of duration $\\Delta t = T/M$.\n\nFor a light source with average intensity $I$, the average number of photons expected in the entire observation period is $\\bar{n} = \\alpha T$, where $\\alpha$ is proportional to the intensity. The average number of photons per time bin is therefore $\\mu = \\bar{n}/M = \\alpha \\Delta t$.\n\nIn a random photon stream, the arrival of each photon is an independent event with no memory of previous arrivals. This means that for small enough time bins, each bin has:\n- A probability $p = \\mu$ of containing exactly one photon\n- A probability $1-p$ of containing no photons\n- A negligible probability of containing more than one photon (for sufficiently small $\\Delta t$)\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-photon-stream .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Generate a random photon stream\nnp.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility\ntotal_time = 10     # Total observation time T\nnum_bins = 200      # Increased number of time bins M to ensure at most 1 photon per bin\ndt = total_time / num_bins  # Width of each time bin\n\n# Average photon rate (mean photons per unit time)\nphoton_rate = 2  # Reduced alpha in the notes to ensure fewer photons\nmean_photons = photon_rate * total_time  # Total mean photon number over time T\nmu = mean_photons / num_bins  # Probability of photon per bin\n\n# Generate random photons based on probability mu for each bin\n# Ensuring at most one photon per bin\nphoton_events = np.random.random(num_bins) < mu\n\n# Generate random positions within each bin for the photons\nphoton_times = []\nfor bin_idx in np.where(photon_events)[0]:\n    # Place photon randomly within its bin, not at the edge\n    rand_position = bin_idx * dt + np.random.random() * dt\n    photon_times.append(rand_position)\n\nphoton_times = np.array(photon_times)\n\n# Verify no bin has more than one photon\nbin_counts = np.histogram(photon_times, bins=num_bins, range=(0, total_time))[0]\nmax_photons_per_bin = np.max(bin_counts)\n\n# Create the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 5))\n\n# Plot vertical lines for each photon\nfor t in photon_times:\n    ax.plot([t, t], [0, 1], 'b-', linewidth=2)\n\n# Add grid lines to show time bins\nfor i in range(num_bins + 1):\n    if i % 10 == 0:  # Only show every 10th grid line to avoid clutter\n        ax.axvline(i * dt, color='lightgray', linestyle='--', alpha=0.5)\n\n# Set axis limits and labels\nax.set_xlim(0, total_time)\nax.set_ylim(0, 2)\nax.set_yticks([])\nax.set_xlabel('Time')\n\n# Add text showing statistics\nactual_count = len(photon_times)\nax.text(0.02, 0.95,\n        f\"Mean photons: {mean_photons:.1f}\\nActual count: {actual_count}\\nMax photons per bin: {max_photons_per_bin}\",\n        transform=ax.transAxes, backgroundcolor='white', fontsize=8)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Random photon stream showing individual photons (vertical lines) arriving at random times.

This is equivalent to asking: what is the probability of having exactly $n$ successes in $M$ independent trials, where the probability of success in each trial is $p = \\mu$?\n\nThis is precisely the binomial distribution:\n\n$$P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} p^n (1-p)^{M-n} = \\binom{M}{n} \\mu^n (1-\\mu)^{M-n}$$\n\nwhere $\\binom{M}{n} = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!}$ is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose $n$ time bins from $M$ total bins.\n\n#### The Poisson Limit\n\nNow, let's consider what happens as we make our time bins smaller and more numerous. In the limit where $M \\to \\infty$ and $\\Delta t \\to 0$, while keeping the total observation time $T$ and the average photon number $\\bar{n}$ constant:\n\n1. The number of bins $M$ increases\n2. The probability per bin $\\mu = \\bar{n}/M$ decreases\n3. The product $M\\mu = \\bar{n}$ remains constant\n\nIn this limit, the binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution. To see this, we substitute $\\mu = \\bar{n}/M$ into the binomial formula:\n\n$$P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^n \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}$$\n\nRearranging:\n\n$$P(n,M) = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{M^n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}$$\n\nAs $M \\to \\infty$, we can use the following approximations:\n\n$$\\frac{M!}{(M-n)!M^n} \\approx 1$$\n\nfor large $M$ and fixed $n$, and:\n\n$$\\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n} \\approx \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^M \\approx e^{-\\bar{n}}$$\n\napplying the limit definition of the exponential function.\n\nThis gives us the Poisson distribution:\n\n$$P(n) = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} P(n,M) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n e^{-\\bar{n}}}{n!}$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{n}$ is the mean photon number in the interval.\n\n\n#### Properties of the Poisson Distribution\n\nThe Poisson distribution has the remarkable property that its variance equals its mean:\n\n$$\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle = \\bar{n}$$\n\nThis equal mean and variance is a signature of the randomness in the photon arrival process, where events occur independently and at a constant average rate.\n\nTo verify this property, we can calculate the mean and variance directly from the probability distribution:\n\nThe mean: $\\langle n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P(n) = \\bar{n}$\n\nThe variance: $\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n-\\bar{n})^2 P(n) = \\bar{n}$\n\n#### Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Random Light\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a crucial metric in experimental physics, quantifying our ability to distinguish a signal from the background noise. For a measurement, the SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean signal to the standard deviation of the noise:\n\n$$\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{signal}}{\\text{noise}} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}$$\n\nFor random light following Poisson statistics, we have:\n\n$$\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}} = \\sqrt{\\bar{n}}$$\n\nThis relationship reveals an important property of random light: the SNR scales as the square root of the mean photon number. This is known as the \"shot noise limit\" and represents a fundamental quantum limit to measurement precision with coherent light. To improve the SNR by a factor of 2, we need to increase the light intensity (or integration time) by a factor of 4.\n\nThis $\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}$ scaling of SNR is a direct consequence of the statistical independence of photon arrivals in coherent light and plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity limits of optical measurements, from astronomical observations to laser-based communications.\n\nThis statistical behavior is characteristic of coherent light sources such as ideal lasers, where photon emission events are independent of each other.\n\n### Beam Splitters and Photon Statistics\n\nA beam splitter is an optical component that splits an incident beam into two parts. For a 50:50 beam splitter, an incoming photon has equal probability of being transmitted or reflected. Interestingly, when random (Poissonian) light is incident on a beam splitter, the statistics of the output beams remain Poissonian.\n\nTo understand why, consider that each photon in the input beam makes an independent decision to be transmitted or reflected. If the input beam has Poisson statistics with mean $\\bar{n}$, the transmitted beam will have a mean of $\\bar{n}_T = R\\bar{n}$ and the reflected beam will have a mean of $\\bar{n}_R = T\\bar{n}$, where $R$ and $T$ are the reflection and transmission coefficients ($R + T = 1$).\n\nThe independence of photon behavior ensures that both output beams maintain Poisson statistics, just with scaled means. This is mathematically represented as:\n\n$$P_T(n_T) = \\frac{(R\\bar{n})^{n_T} e^{-R\\bar{n}}}{n_T!}$$\n\n$$P_R(n_R) = \\frac{(T\\bar{n})^{n_R} e^{-T\\bar{n}}}{n_R!}$$\n\nThis preservation of statistics is a direct consequence of the binomial sampling of the original Poisson distribution, which yields another Poisson distribution.\n\n### Thermal Light and Exponential Statistics\n\nThermal light, such as that emitted by incandescent bulbs or stars, exhibits different statistical properties. The emission process in thermal sources involves atoms transitioning between energy levels due to thermal excitation. This process leads to what we call \"bunching\" of photons.\n\nFor thermal light, the probability distribution of photons follows:\n\n$$P(n) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{(1+\\bar{n})^{n+1}}$$\n\nThis distribution results in a variance that exceeds the mean:\n\n$$\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle + \\langle n \\rangle^2 = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2$$\n\nThe photon number fluctuations are larger than in coherent light, reflecting the bunching tendency of thermal photons. This bunching arises from the Bose-Einstein statistics governing photons, which encourages multiple photons to occupy the same mode.\n\nThe intensity fluctuations of thermal light follow an exponential distribution:\n\n$$P(I) = \\frac{1}{\\langle I \\rangle} e^{-I/\\langle I \\rangle}$$\n\nThis exponential behavior is a direct consequence of the random nature of thermal emission processes, where the radiation field is built up from the contributions of many independent atomic emitters.\n\n#### Signal-to-Noise Ratio for Thermal Light\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio for thermal light differs significantly from that of coherent light due to the different statistical distribution of photons. Using the definition of SNR as the ratio of mean signal to the standard deviation of noise:\n\n$$\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}$$\n\nFor thermal light, with $\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2$, we have:\n\n$$\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2}} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\bar{n}} + 1}}$$\n\nIn the limit of large photon numbers ($\\bar{n} \\gg 1$), which is common for thermal light sources, this simplifies to:\n\n$$\\text{SNR} \\approx \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}} = 1$$\n\nThis is a striking result: for thermal light at high intensities, the SNR approaches a constant value of 1, regardless of how much we increase the intensity. This is in stark contrast to the coherent light case where SNR increases as $\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}$.\n\nThis fundamental limitation on the SNR of thermal light is due to the inherent \"excess noise\" from photon bunching. It explains why many precision optical measurements preferentially use laser sources (with Poisson statistics) rather than thermal sources, even when high intensities are available.\n\nThe comparison between thermal light (SNR ~ 1) and coherent light (SNR ~ $\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}$) provides a clear example of how the quantum statistical properties of a light source directly impact measurement sensitivity in practical applications.\n\n",
