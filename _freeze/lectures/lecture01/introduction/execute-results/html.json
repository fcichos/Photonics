Optical frequencies (~100 THz) offer approximately 10,000 times more bandwidth than the highest practical electronic frequencies (~10 GHz).\n- **Propagation Losses**: Modern optical fibers achieve losses of ~0.2 dB/km, while electronic transmission lines typically experience losses of 10-100 dB/km at high frequencies.\n- **Energy Per Bit**: Theoretical minimum energy to transmit one bit optically is orders of magnitude lower than electronic transmission (~10^-18 J vs ~10^-15 J).\n\n## Quantum Mechanical Considerations\n\n- **Coherence Properties**: Photons maintain quantum coherence over much longer distances than electrons in solid-state environments, enabling quantum information applications.\n- **Non-interacting Bosons**: Unlike electrons (fermions), photons don't directly interact with each other, allowing signals to cross without interference.\n\n",
