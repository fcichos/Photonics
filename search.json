    "text": "In classical optics, light is treated as an electromagnetic wave. However, at the quantum level, light consists of discrete energy packets called photons. The statistical distribution of these photons provides profound insights into the nature of light sources.\n\n\n\n\nTo understand photon statistics, we first need to conceptualize light as a stream of discrete photons arriving at a detector over time. Let’s develop a model where we divide our total observation time \\(T\\) into \\(M\\) equal time bins, each of duration \\(\\Delta t = T/M\\).\nFor a light source with average intensity \\(I\\), the average number of photons expected in the entire observation period is \\(\\bar{n} = \\alpha T\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is proportional to the intensity. The average number of photons per time bin is therefore \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M = \\alpha \\Delta t\\).\nIn a random photon stream, the arrival of each photon is an independent event with no memory of previous arrivals. This means that for small enough time bins, each bin has: - A probability \\(p = \\mu\\) of containing exactly one photon - A probability \\(1-p\\) of containing no photons - A negligible probability of containing more than one photon (for sufficiently small \\(\\Delta t\\))\n\n\n\nGiven these properties, we can calculate the probability \\(P(n,M)\\) of detecting exactly \\(n\\) photons in \\(M\\) time bins. This is equivalent to asking: what is the probability of having exactly \\(n\\) successes in \\(M\\) independent trials, where the probability of success in each trial is \\(p = \\mu\\)?\nThis is precisely the binomial distribution:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} p^n (1-p)^{M-n} = \\binom{M}{n} \\mu^n (1-\\mu)^{M-n}\\]\nwhere \\(\\binom{M}{n} = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!}\\) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) time bins from \\(M\\) total bins.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s consider what happens as we make our time bins smaller and more numerous. In the limit where \\(M \\to \\infty\\) and \\(\\Delta t \\to 0\\), while keeping the total observation time \\(T\\) and the average photon number \\(\\bar{n}\\) constant:\n\nThe number of bins \\(M\\) increases\nThe probability per bin \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M\\) decreases\nThe product \\(M\\mu = \\bar{n}\\) remains constant\n\nIn this limit, the binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution. To see this, we substitute \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M\\) into the binomial formula:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^n \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{M^n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}\\]\nAs \\(M \\to \\infty\\), we can use the following approximations:\n\\[\\frac{M!}{(M-n)!M^n} \\approx 1\\]\nfor large \\(M\\) and fixed \\(n\\), and:\n\\[\\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n} \\approx \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^M \\approx e^{-\\bar{n}}\\]\napplying the limit definition of the exponential function.\nThis gives us the Poisson distribution:\n\\[P(n) = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} P(n,M) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n e^{-\\bar{n}}}{n!}\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{n}\\) is the mean photon number in the interval.\n\n\n\nThe Poisson distribution has the remarkable property that its variance equals its mean:\n\\[\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle = \\bar{n}\\]\nThis equal mean and variance is a signature of the randomness in the photon arrival process, where events occur independently and at a constant average rate.\nTo verify this property, we can calculate the mean and variance directly from the probability distribution:\nThe mean: \\(\\langle n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P(n) = \\bar{n}\\)\nThe variance: \\(\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n-\\bar{n})^2 P(n) = \\bar{n}\\)\n\n\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a crucial metric in experimental physics, quantifying our ability to distinguish a signal from the background noise. For a measurement, the SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean signal to the standard deviation of the noise:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{signal}}{\\text{noise}} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}\\]\nFor random light following Poisson statistics, we have:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}} = \\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\]\nThis relationship reveals an important property of random light: the SNR scales as the square root of the mean photon number. This is known as the “shot noise limit” and represents a fundamental quantum limit to measurement precision with coherent light. To improve the SNR by a factor of 2, we need to increase the light intensity (or integration time) by a factor of 4.\nThis \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\) scaling of SNR is a direct consequence of the statistical independence of photon arrivals in coherent light and plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity limits of optical measurements, from astronomical observations to laser-based communications.\nThis statistical behavior is characteristic of coherent light sources such as ideal lasers, where photon emission events are independent of each other.\n\n\n\n\nA beam splitter is an optical component that splits an incident beam into two parts. For a 50:50 beam splitter, an incoming photon has equal probability of being transmitted or reflected. Interestingly, when random (Poissonian) light is incident on a beam splitter, the statistics of the output beams remain Poissonian.\nTo understand why, consider that each photon in the input beam makes an independent decision to be transmitted or reflected. If the input beam has Poisson statistics with mean \\(\\bar{n}\\), the transmitted beam will have a mean of \\(\\bar{n}_T = R\\bar{n}\\) and the reflected beam will have a mean of \\(\\bar{n}_R = T\\bar{n}\\), where \\(R\\) and \\(T\\) are the reflection and transmission coefficients (\\(R + T = 1\\)).\nThe independence of photon behavior ensures that both output beams maintain Poisson statistics, just with scaled means. This is mathematically represented as:\n\\[P_T(n_T) = \\frac{(R\\bar{n})^{n_T} e^{-R\\bar{n}}}{n_T!}\\]\n\\[P_R(n_R) = \\frac{(T\\bar{n})^{n_R} e^{-T\\bar{n}}}{n_R!}\\]\nThis preservation of statistics is a direct consequence of the binomial sampling of the original Poisson distribution, which yields another Poisson distribution.\n\n\n\nThermal light, such as that emitted by incandescent bulbs or stars, exhibits different statistical properties. The emission process in thermal sources involves atoms transitioning between energy levels due to thermal excitation. This process leads to what we call “bunching” of photons.\nFor thermal light, the probability distribution of photons follows:\n\\[P(n) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{(1+\\bar{n})^{n+1}}\\]\nThis distribution results in a variance that exceeds the mean:\n\\[\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle + \\langle n \\rangle^2 = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2\\]\nThe photon number fluctuations are larger than in coherent light, reflecting the bunching tendency of thermal photons. This bunching arises from the Bose-Einstein statistics governing photons, which encourages multiple photons to occupy the same mode.\nThe intensity fluctuations of thermal light follow an exponential distribution:\n\\[P(I) = \\frac{1}{\\langle I \\rangle} e^{-I/\\langle I \\rangle}\\]\nThis exponential behavior is a direct consequence of the random nature of thermal emission processes, where the radiation field is built up from the contributions of many independent atomic emitters.\n\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio for thermal light differs significantly from that of coherent light due to the different statistical distribution of photons. Using the definition of SNR as the ratio of mean signal to the standard deviation of noise:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}\\]\nFor thermal light, with \\(\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2\\), we have:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2}} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\bar{n}} + 1}}\\]\nIn the limit of large photon numbers (\\(\\bar{n} \\gg 1\\)), which is common for thermal light sources, this simplifies to:\n\\[\\text{SNR} \\approx \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}} = 1\\]\nThis is a striking result: for thermal light at high intensities, the SNR approaches a constant value of 1, regardless of how much we increase the intensity. This is in stark contrast to the coherent light case where SNR increases as \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\).\nThis fundamental limitation on the SNR of thermal light is due to the inherent “excess noise” from photon bunching. It explains why many precision optical measurements preferentially use laser sources (with Poisson statistics) rather than thermal sources, even when high intensities are available.\nThe comparison between thermal light (SNR ~ 1) and coherent light (SNR ~ \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\)) provides a clear example of how the quantum statistical properties of a light source directly impact measurement sensitivity in practical applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo transition from classical optics to quantum optics, we need to quantize the electromagnetic field. We start with Maxwell’s equations in vacuum and consider a single mode of the field in a cavity of volume \\(V\\).\nThe classical electric and magnetic fields for a mode with wavevector \\(\\vec{k}\\) and polarization \\(\\vec{\\epsilon}\\) can be written as:\n\\[\\vec{E}(\\vec{r},t) = E_0(a(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\] \\[\\vec{B}(\\vec{r},t) = B_0(a(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\]\nwhere \\(E_0\\) and \\(B_0\\) are constants, and \\(a(t)\\) and \\(a^*(t)\\) are complex amplitudes.\nThe energy of this field is:\n\\[H = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_V (\\epsilon_0 E^2 + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}B^2)d^3r = \\hbar\\omega(a^*a + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nObserve that this has the same form as the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator. This suggests replacing the complex amplitudes \\(a\\) and \\(a^*\\) with operators \\(\\hat{a}\\) and \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) that satisfy the commutation relation:\n\\[[\\hat{a}, \\hat{a}^\\dagger] = 1\\]\nThe Hamiltonian then becomes:\n\\[\\hat{H} = \\hbar\\omega(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a} + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nThis is precisely the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator, where \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\) is the number operator \\(\\hat{n}\\) that counts the number of photons in the mode.\n\n\n\nThe energy eigenstates of this quantum harmonic oscillator are the Fock states \\(|n\\rangle\\), which represent states with exactly \\(n\\) photons. The action of the creation and annihilation operators on these states is:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle\\] \\[\\hat{a}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle\\]\nJust as in a mechanical harmonic oscillator with position \\(x\\) and momentum \\(p\\), we can define quadrature components for the quantized electromagnetic field:\n\\[\\hat{X} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{P} = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{a})\\]\nThese operators are analogous to the position and momentum operators of a mechanical oscillator and satisfy the commutation relation:\n\\[[\\hat{X}, \\hat{P}] = i\\]\nThe physical interpretation of these quadratures becomes clear when we look at the expectation value of the electric field operator in a coherent state \\(|\\alpha\\rangle\\) (which is the quantum state that most closely resembles a classical electromagnetic wave):\n\\[\\langle\\alpha|\\hat{E}(\\vec{r},t)|\\alpha\\rangle \\propto \\langle\\alpha|(\\hat{a}e^{-i\\omega t} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger e^{i\\omega t})|\\alpha\\rangle = 2|\\alpha|\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha = |\\alpha|e^{i\\phi}\\).\nWe can see that \\(\\hat{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{P}\\) correspond to the amplitude and phase quadratures of the field, respectively. They are the quantum analogs of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of a classical electromagnetic wave.\nThe uncertainty principle for these quadratures,\n\\[\\Delta X \\cdot \\Delta P \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\]\nimplies fundamental limits on our ability to simultaneously determine both quadratures with arbitrary precision. This leads to interesting quantum states of light such as squeezed states, where the uncertainty in one quadrature is reduced below the standard quantum limit at the expense of increased uncertainty in the conjugate quadrature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum optics is the creation of entangled photon states. A beam splitter, beyond its classical role, can actually generate quantum entanglement under specific conditions.\nConsider a situation where two identical photons simultaneously enter a 50:50 beam splitter from different input ports. Quantum mechanically, we denote the creation operators for the input ports as \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{b}^\\dagger\\), and for the output ports as \\(\\hat{c}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{d}^\\dagger\\).\nThe beam splitter transformation can be written as:\n\\[\\hat{c}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{d}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\]\nThe initial state with one photon in each input port is \\(|1_a, 1_b\\rangle = \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle\\). After passing through the beam splitter, this state becomes:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{c}^\\dagger + \\hat{d}^\\dagger)(\\hat{c}^\\dagger - \\hat{d}^\\dagger)|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}((\\hat{c}^\\dagger)^2 - (\\hat{d}^\\dagger)^2)|0\\rangle\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_c, 0_d\\rangle - |0_c, 2_d\\rangle)\\]\nThis is an entangled state where either both photons exit through port \\(c\\) or both exit through port \\(d\\), with no possibility of one photon in each output port. This phenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is a direct manifestation of quantum interference and photon indistinguishability.\nThe entanglement is evident because the state cannot be factorized into a product of states for the two output modes. This non-classical correlation is a resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols.\n\n\n\nWe can also understand photon entanglement through the language of probability amplitudes and phase factors, which may be more intuitive for visualizing what happens at a beam splitter.\nWhen a single photon encounters a beam splitter, there are two possible outcomes: reflection or transmission. In quantum mechanics, we associate probability amplitudes with each outcome:\n\nFor reflection: amplitude \\(r = \\sqrt{R}e^{i\\phi_r}\\), where \\(R\\) is the reflection probability and \\(\\phi_r\\) is a phase factor\nFor transmission: amplitude \\(t = \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\phi_t}\\), where \\(T\\) is the transmission probability and \\(\\phi_t\\) is a phase factor\n\nFor a 50:50 beam splitter, \\(R = T = 1/2\\). Importantly, the phase relationship between reflection and transmission must satisfy \\(\\phi_r - \\phi_t = \\pi/2\\) for energy conservation, which is typically implemented as \\(r = 1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(t = i/\\sqrt{2}\\), where the imaginary unit \\(i\\) represents a 90u00b0 phase shift.\nNow, consider two photons entering the beam splitter from different input ports (let’s call them 1 and 2). There are four possible outcomes:\n\nBoth photons are reflected: Amplitude = \\(r_1 r_2 = 1/2\\)\nBoth photons are transmitted: Amplitude = \\(t_1 t_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})^2 = i^2/2 = -1/2\\)\nPhoton 1 reflected, Photon 2 transmitted: Amplitude = \\(r_1 t_2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})(i/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\nPhoton 1 transmitted, Photon 2 reflected: Amplitude = \\(t_1 r_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\n\nThe key insight comes when we consider the output ports (let’s call them 3 and 4). For both photons to exit through port 3, either both must be reflected or both must be transmitted. The combined amplitude is:\n\\[A_{both~in~3} = r_1 r_2 + t_1 t_2 = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\\]\nSimilarly, for both photons to exit through port 4:\n\\[A_{both~in~4} = t_1 r_2 + r_1 t_2 = i/2 + i/2 = i\\]\nFor one photon in each output port, the amplitude is zero due to destructive interference.\nSquaring these amplitudes to get probabilities:\n\nProbability of both photons in port 3: \\(|0|^2 = 0\\)\nProbability of both photons in port 4: \\(|i|^2 = 1\\)\nProbability of one photon in each port: \\(0\\)\n\nThis means the photons always exit together through the same port (in this case, port 4), never one in each port. The two photons are now entangled - they behave as a single entity rather than two independent particles.\nIf we adjust our phase convention slightly to maintain symmetry between the ports, we get the state:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_3, 0_4\\rangle - |0_3, 2_4\\rangle)\\]\nwhich matches our result from the operator formalism.\nThis phase-dependent quantum interference demonstrates how the simple process of reflection and transmission, combined with the wave nature of quantum particles, leads to complex phenomena like entanglement. The phase factors are crucial - without the \\(\\pi/2\\) phase difference between reflection and transmission, this entanglement would not occur.\n\n\n\n\nThis introduction has taken us from the statistical nature of photons to the quantum description of the electromagnetic field. We’ve seen how random photon streams lead to Poisson statistics, how beam splitters interact with these statistics, and how thermal light exhibits exponential intensity distribution due to the bunching of photons.\nWe’ve also established the connection between Maxwell’s equations and the quantum harmonic oscillator, introducing the concept of photon number states and field quadratures. Finally, we’ve explored how beam splitters can create quantum entanglement between photons, demonstrating the non-classical nature of light.\nThese foundations of quantum optics open the door to a rich field of study, including quantum information processing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication, where the quantum properties of light are harnessed for technological applications beyond the capabilities of classical systems."

We start with Maxwell’s equations in vacuum and consider a single mode of the field in a cavity of volume \\(V\\).\nThe classical electric and magnetic fields for a mode with wavevector \\(\\vec{k}\\) and polarization \\(\\vec{\\epsilon}\\) can be written as:\n\\[\\vec{E}(\\vec{r},t) = E_0(a(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\] \\[\\vec{B}(\\vec{r},t) = B_0(a(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\]\nwhere \\(E_0\\) and \\(B_0\\) are constants, and \\(a(t)\\) and \\(a^*(t)\\) are complex amplitudes.\nThe energy of this field is:\n\\[H = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_V (\\epsilon_0 E^2 + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}B^2)d^3r = \\hbar\\omega(a^*a + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nObserve that this has the same form as the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator. This suggests replacing the complex amplitudes \\(a\\) and \\(a^*\\) with operators \\(\\hat{a}\\) and \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) that satisfy the commutation relation:\n\\[[\\hat{a}, \\hat{a}^\\dagger] = 1\\]\nThe Hamiltonian then becomes:\n\\[\\hat{H} = \\hbar\\omega(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a} + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nThis is precisely the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator, where \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\) is the number operator \\(\\hat{n}\\) that counts the number of photons in the mode.\n\n\n\nThe energy eigenstates of this quantum harmonic oscillator are the Fock states \\(|n\\rangle\\), which represent states with exactly \\(n\\) photons. The action of the creation and annihilation operators on these states is:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle\\] \\[\\hat{a}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle\\]\nJust as in a mechanical harmonic oscillator with position \\(x\\) and momentum \\(p\\), we can define quadrature components for the quantized electromagnetic field:\n\\[\\hat{X} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{P} = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{a})\\]\nThese operators are analogous to the position and momentum operators of a mechanical oscillator and satisfy the commutation relation:\n\\[[\\hat{X}, \\hat{P}] = i\\]\nThe physical interpretation of these quadratures becomes clear when we look at the expectation value of the electric field operator in a coherent state \\(|\\alpha\\rangle\\) (which is the quantum state that most closely resembles a classical electromagnetic wave):\n\\[\\langle\\alpha|\\hat{E}(\\vec{r},t)|\\alpha\\rangle \\propto \\langle\\alpha|(\\hat{a}e^{-i\\omega t} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger e^{i\\omega t})|\\alpha\\rangle = 2|\\alpha|\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha = |\\alpha|e^{i\\phi}\\).\nWe can see that \\(\\hat{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{P}\\) correspond to the amplitude and phase quadratures of the field, respectively. They are the quantum analogs of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of a classical electromagnetic wave.\nThe uncertainty principle for these quadratures,\n\\[\\Delta X \\cdot \\Delta P \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\]\nimplies fundamental limits on our ability to simultaneously determine both quadratures with arbitrary precision. This leads to interesting quantum states of light such as squeezed states, where the uncertainty in one quadrature is reduced below the standard quantum limit at the expense of increased uncertainty in the conjugate quadrature."

    "text": "One of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum optics is the creation of entangled photon states. A beam splitter, beyond its classical role, can actually generate quantum entanglement under specific conditions.\nConsider a situation where two identical photons simultaneously enter a 50:50 beam splitter from different input ports. Quantum mechanically, we denote the creation operators for the input ports as \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{b}^\\dagger\\), and for the output ports as \\(\\hat{c}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{d}^\\dagger\\).\nThe beam splitter transformation can be written as:\n\\[\\hat{c}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{d}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\]\nThe initial state with one photon in each input port is \\(|1_a, 1_b\\rangle = \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle\\). After passing through the beam splitter, this state becomes:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{c}^\\dagger + \\hat{d}^\\dagger)(\\hat{c}^\\dagger - \\hat{d}^\\dagger)|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}((\\hat{c}^\\dagger)^2 - (\\hat{d}^\\dagger)^2)|0\\rangle\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_c, 0_d\\rangle - |0_c, 2_d\\rangle)\\]\nThis is an entangled state where either both photons exit through port \\(c\\) or both exit through port \\(d\\), with no possibility of one photon in each output port. This phenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is a direct manifestation of quantum interference and photon indistinguishability.\nThe entanglement is evident because the state cannot be factorized into a product of states for the two output modes. This non-classical correlation is a resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols.\n\n\n\nWe can also understand photon entanglement through the language of probability amplitudes and phase factors, which may be more intuitive for visualizing what happens at a beam splitter.\nWhen a single photon encounters a beam splitter, there are two possible outcomes: reflection or transmission. In quantum mechanics, we associate probability amplitudes with each outcome:\n\nFor reflection: amplitude \\(r = \\sqrt{R}e^{i\\phi_r}\\), where \\(R\\) is the reflection probability and \\(\\phi_r\\) is a phase factor\nFor transmission: amplitude \\(t = \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\phi_t}\\), where \\(T\\) is the transmission probability and \\(\\phi_t\\) is a phase factor\n\nFor a 50:50 beam splitter, \\(R = T = 1/2\\). Importantly, the phase relationship between reflection and transmission must satisfy \\(\\phi_r - \\phi_t = \\pi/2\\) for energy conservation, which is typically implemented as \\(r = 1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(t = i/\\sqrt{2}\\), where the imaginary unit \\(i\\) represents a 90u00b0 phase shift.\nNow, consider two photons entering the beam splitter from different input ports (let’s call them 1 and 2). There are four possible outcomes:\n\nBoth photons are reflected: Amplitude = \\(r_1 r_2 = 1/2\\)\nBoth photons are transmitted: Amplitude = \\(t_1 t_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})^2 = i^2/2 = -1/2\\)\nPhoton 1 reflected, Photon 2 transmitted: Amplitude = \\(r_1 t_2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})(i/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\nPhoton 1 transmitted, Photon 2 reflected: Amplitude = \\(t_1 r_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\n\nThe key insight comes when we consider the output ports (let’s call them 3 and 4). For both photons to exit through port 3, either both must be reflected or both must be transmitted. The combined amplitude is:\n\\[A_{both~in~3} = r_1 r_2 + t_1 t_2 = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\\]\nSimilarly, for both photons to exit through port 4:\n\\[A_{both~in~4} = t_1 r_2 + r_1 t_2 = i/2 + i/2 = i\\]\nFor one photon in each output port, the amplitude is zero due to destructive interference.\nSquaring these amplitudes to get probabilities:\n\nProbability of both photons in port 3: \\(|0|^2 = 0\\)\nProbability of both photons in port 4: \\(|i|^2 = 1\\)\nProbability of one photon in each port: \\(0\\)\n\nThis means the photons always exit together through the same port (in this case, port 4), never one in each port. The two photons are now entangled - they behave as a single entity rather than two independent particles.\nIf we adjust our phase convention slightly to maintain symmetry between the ports, we get the state:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_3, 0_4\\rangle - |0_3, 2_4\\rangle)\\]\nwhich matches our result from the operator formalism.\nThis phase-dependent quantum interference demonstrates how the simple process of reflection and transmission, combined with the wave nature of quantum particles, leads to complex phenomena like entanglement. The phase factors are crucial - without the \\(\\pi/2\\) phase difference between reflection and transmission, this entanglement would not occur."

    "text": "Light has been described through increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks throughout the history of physics. The simplest framework is Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics, which treats light as rays traveling along straight paths and applies geometrical principles to describe interactions with optical elements like lenses and mirrors. Moving beyond this approximation, Wave Optics introduces the wave nature of light, explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction that ray optics cannot address. Electromagnetic Optics further refines our understanding by treating light as electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell’s equations, providing a complete classical description of light-matter interactions. For intense light sources, Nonlinear Optics becomes essential, describing how materials respond nonlinearly to strong electromagnetic fields, giving rise to frequency conversion and other novel effects. Finally, at the most fundamental level, Quantum Optics treats light as consisting of photons—quantum mechanical particles exhibiting both wave and particle properties—essential for understanding phenomena like spontaneous emission, entanglement, and the quantum nature of light-matter interactions. This course will progressively build your understanding through these increasingly sophisticated frameworks.\n\n\nRay optics, or geometric optics, provides a powerful framework for understanding light propagation when the wavelength is much smaller than the dimensions of optical elements involved. In this approach, light travels along straight lines called rays in homogeneous media, with well-defined paths that can be mathematically traced. This description serves as the foundation for analyzing many optical systems, from simple mirrors to complex microscopes and telescopes.\n\n\nFermat’s Principle forms one of the foundations of ray optics, stating that light travels along the route that takes the total optical path length between any two points to an extremum (commonly a minimum). This optical path length, expressed mathematically as \\(\\int_C n(s)ds\\), represents the effective distance light traverses through media of varying refractive indices. When this quantity is divided by the vacuum speed of light \\(c_0\\), it yields the total travel time required for light to journey between those points.\nIn its integral form:\n\\[\\delta\\int_C n(s)ds = 0\\]\nwhere \\(n(s)\\) is the refractive index along path \\(C\\) and \\(ds\\) is the differential path length.\nThe same principle can be expressed as a differential equation that describes how light bends in media with varying refractive indices:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis equation shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index. In homogeneous media (\\(\\nabla n = 0\\)), it simplifies to \\(\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = 0\\), confirming that light follows straight lines.\n\n\n\nReflection: At a planar interface, Fermat’s Principle directly yields the law of reflection:\n\\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the surface.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_path_length(x, start, end):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)\n    d2 = np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, 3)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate path lengths\npath_lengths = [calculate_path_length(x, start_point, end_point) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(path_lengths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5,alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-')\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start point')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go',  label='end point')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro',  label='reflection Point')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-0.7, -1, \"mirror\")\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Fermat’s principle for reflection of light at an interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reflection at a planar interface, we consider a ray traveling from point A to point B via reflection at point P on a mirror, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-reflection}\\). The total path length is \\(L = |AP| + |PB|\\).\nLet’s establish a coordinate system where the mirror lies along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((-a, h_1)\\) and point B is at \\((b, h_2)\\), with the reflection point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total path length is:\n\\[L(x) = \\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2} + \\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, the actual path minimizes \\(L\\), so we differentiate with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} - \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\]\nNow, let’s interpret this geometrically. The angle of incidence \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle between the incident ray AP and the normal to the mirror (y-axis). Similarly, the angle of reflection \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle between the reflected ray PB and the normal.\nFrom trigonometry:\n\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}}\\)\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_r) = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\)\n\nTherefore, our minimization condition directly yields: \\[\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sin(\\theta_r)\\]\nSince both angles are measured in the same quadrant (from the normal to the mirror), this equality implies: \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nThis is the law of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nLaw of Reflection: The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\n\n\n\nRefraction: Between media with different refractive indices, Fermat’s Principle yields Snell’s law:\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_optical_path(x, start, end, n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total optical path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = n1 * np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)  # Optical path in medium 1\n    d2 = n2 * np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)      # Optical path in medium 2\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, -3)\n\n# Define refractive indices\nn1 = 1.0  # Medium 1 (above interface)\nn2 = 1.5  # Medium 2 (below interface)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate optical path lengths\noptical_paths = [calculate_optical_path(x, start_point, end_point, n1, n2) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(optical_paths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5, alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-', lw=1)\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go', label='end')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro', label='refraction')\n\n# Calculate and draw angles\n# Incident ray\ndx1 = min_x - start_point[0]\ndy1 = 0 - start_point[1]\nincident_angle = np.arctan2(-dy1, dx1)\ntheta1 = np.pi/2 - incident_angle\n\n# Refracted ray\ndx2 = end_point[0] - min_x\ndy2 = end_point[1] - 0\nrefracted_angle = np.arctan2(dy2, dx2)\ntheta2 = np.pi/2 + refracted_angle\n\n# Draw angle arcs\n\n# Add angle labels\nax.text(min_x + 0.3, 0.3, r'$\\theta_1$', color='blue')\nax.text(min_x - 0.5, -0.3, r'$\\theta_2$', color='green')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-3, 0.5, f\"n₁ = {n1}\", color='blue')\nax.text(-3, -0.5, f\"n₂ = {n2}\", color='green')\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Snell’s Law from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefraction Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor refraction between two media with different refractive indices, we apply Fermat’s principle to find the path that minimizes the total optical path length. Consider a ray traveling from point A in medium 1 to point B in medium 2, with refraction occurring at point P on the interface, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-refraction}\\).\nThe total optical path length is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nTo determine the exact refraction point P that minimizes this path, we establish a coordinate system with the interface along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((x_A, y_A)\\) where \\(y_A &gt; 0\\), and point B is at \\((x_B, y_B)\\) where \\(y_B &lt; 0\\), with the refraction point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total optical path length is:\n\\[L(x) = n_1\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2} + n_2\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, we minimize \\(L\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(x\\) and setting it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1\\frac{x-x_A}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} - n_2\\frac{x_B-x}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1(x-x_A)}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} = \\frac{n_2(x_B-x)}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\]\nFrom geometry, we can identify the sine of the angles of incidence and refraction:\n\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{|AP|} = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}}\\)\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{|PB|} = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\)\n\nTaking the sign into account based on our coordinate system, our minimization condition becomes:\n\\[n_1\\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2\\sin(\\theta_2)\\]\nThis is Snell’s law, stating that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\nSnell’s Law: The ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the reciprocal of the ratio of the refractive indices. \\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef snell(n1, n2, theta1):\n    sin_theta2 = n1 * np.sin(theta1) / n2\n    theta2 = np.arcsin(np.clip(sin_theta2, -1, 1))\n    theta2[sin_theta2 &gt; 1] = np.nan\n    return theta2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))\n\ntheta1 = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\ntheta2_1_to_1_5 = snell(1.0, 1.5, theta1)\ntheta2_1_5_to_1 = snell(1.5, 1.0, theta1)\ntheta2_1_to_1 = snell(1.0, 1.0, theta1)\n\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1_5), color='blue')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_5_to_1), color='red')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1), color='green', linestyle='--')\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta_1$ [°]')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\theta_2$ [°]')\nax.set_xlim(0, 90)\nax.set_ylim(0, 90)\n\nax.plot([0, 90], [0, 90], color='gray', linestyle=':', label='y=x')\n\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1.5$', xy=(60, 35), xytext=(50, 20),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='blue')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_1}{n_2}=1.5$', xy=(30, 50), xytext=(10, 70),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='red')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1$', xy=(45, 45), xytext=(65, 50),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='green')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices.

Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (\\(n_1\\)) to one with a lower refractive index (\\(n_2\\)), a fascinating phenomenon can occur. As the angle of incidence increases, the refracted ray bends away from the normal until, at a critical angle, it travels along the boundary between the two media. Beyond this critical angle, light can no longer pass into the second medium and is instead completely reflected back into the first medium. This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection (TIR).\nFrom Snell’s law, the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) occurs when the refracted angle \\(\\theta_2 = 90°\\):\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_c = n_2\\sin(90°) = n_2\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nFor total internal reflection to occur, two conditions must be satisfied:\n\nLight must travel from a higher to a lower refractive index medium (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\))\nThe angle of incidence must exceed the critical angle (\\(\\theta_1 &gt; \\theta_c\\))\n\nFrom Fermat’s principle perspective, total internal reflection represents a scenario where no physical path through the second medium can satisfy the minimum optical path length requirement. Instead, the path of least time becomes the reflected path within the original medium. This phenomenon has numerous practical applications, including:\n\nFiber optic communication: Light signals travel long distances through optical fibers via successive total internal reflections with minimal loss\nPrisms and reflectors: Total internal reflection in prisms provides perfect reflection without needing reflective coatings\nGemstones: The brilliance of diamonds results from light being trapped through multiple internal reflections\nOptical instruments: Binoculars, periscopes, and endoscopes use prisms with TIR to redirect light\n\nTotal internal reflection demonstrates how Fermat’s principle enforces an absolute constraint on light’s behavior—when no path through the second medium can minimize the optical path length, light must remain in the first medium, following the path of least time.\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4— Total internal reflection in an optical fiber.\n\n\n\nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Aperture\n\n\n\nThe Numerical Aperture of a fiber is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the differential ray equation from Fermat’s integral principle, we apply the calculus of variations. Starting with the optical path length functional:\n\\[L = \\int_C n(s)ds = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\) parametrizes the path. The term \\(\\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right|\\) represents the differential element of arc length \\(ds\\) along the path, so \\(ds = \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\). This parametrization allows us to convert the path integral over the curve \\(C\\) into a definite integral over the parameter \\(t\\). According to Fermat’s principle, the true path makes this integral stationary (δL = 0).\nConsider a small variation in the path: \\(\\mathbf{r}(t) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)\\) where \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}(t_1) = \\mathbf{\\eta}(t_2) = 0\\) (fixed endpoints). Expanding the variation of the integral to first order in ε:\n\\[\\delta L = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t))\\right| dt\\]\nUsing the chain rule and reparametrizing with arc length \\(s\\) (where \\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) is a unit vector), the stationarity condition leads to:\n\\[\\int_C \\left[ \\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{\\eta} - \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\eta} \\right] ds = 0\\]\nSince this must hold for any variation \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}\\), we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, directly analogous to how a mechanical particle’s trajectory is affected by a potential field in classical mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELFOC Gradient Index Lens\n\n\n\n\n\nSELFOC (SELf-FOCusing) gradient-index fibers are interesting optical elements that guide light through a continuous refraction process rather than discrete refractions at interfaces. Let me demonstrate how Fermat’s principle can be used to determine the ray paths in these fibers. A SELFOC fiber has a radially varying refractive index, typically following a parabolic profile:\n\\[n(r) = n_0\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 r^2\\right)\\]\nwhere: - \\(n_0\\) is the refractive index at the central axis - \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the axis - \\(\\alpha\\) is the gradient constant that determines how quickly the index decreases with radius\n\n\nFor a medium with a spatially varying refractive index, Fermat’s principle states that light follows the path that minimizes the optical path length:\n\\[\\delta \\int_C n(r) ds = 0\\]\nThis yields the differential equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\n\n\n\nFor our parabolic index profile, the gradient of the refractive index is:\n\\[\\nabla n = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -n_0\\alpha^2 r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\]\nUsing cylindrical coordinates with z along the fiber axis, and assuming the paraxial approximation (rays make small angles with the z-axis), we can simplify the ray equation to:\n\\[\\frac{d^2r}{dz^2} + \\alpha^2 r = 0\\]\nThis is the equation for a harmonic oscillator, which has the solution:\n\\[r(z) = r_0 \\cos(\\alpha z) + \\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha} \\sin(\\alpha z)\\]\nwhere \\(r_0\\) is the initial radial position and \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the ray with respect to the fiber axis.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Central refractive index\nalpha = 0.3  # Gradient constant (mm^-1)\nlength = 30  # Length of fiber (mm)\nradius = 1.5  # Radius of fiber (mm)\n\n# Create a grid for visualization\nz = np.linspace(0, length, 300)\nr_grid = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\nZ, R = np.meshgrid(z, r_grid)\n\n# Calculate refractive index at each point\nN = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * R)**2)\n\n# Initialize ray paths\nr0_values = [0.6, 1.0, 1.4]  # Initial radial positions\ntheta0_values = [0, 0.2, -0.2]    # Initial angles (all parallel to axis)\n\n# Plot setup\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(15, 5), gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [3, 1]})\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile in the first subplot\ncmap = plt.cm.viridis\nextent = [0, length, -radius, radius]\nim = ax1.imshow(np.vstack((N[::-1], N)), extent=extent,\n               aspect='auto', cmap=cmap, origin='lower',alpha=0.2)\nfig.colorbar(im, ax=ax1, label='n(y)')\n\n# Plot ray paths\nfor r0, theta0 in zip(r0_values, theta0_values):\n    # Calculate ray path\n    r = r0 * np.cos(alpha * z) + (theta0/alpha) * np.sin(alpha * z)\n\n    # Plot ray path\n    ax1.plot(z, r, 'r-')\n    ax1.plot(z, -r, 'r-')  # Symmetric ray below axis\n\n# Add labels and title for first subplot\nax1.set_xlabel('z [mm]')\nax1.set_ylabel('y [mm]')\n\n# For the right subplot, plot r-position vs refractive index\n# Create a finer array of radial positions for a smooth curve\nr_positions = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\n# Calculate refractive index at each radial position\nn_profile = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * r_positions)**2)\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile\nax2.plot( n_profile,r_positions, 'k-')\nax2.plot( n_profile,-r_positions, 'k-')\n\n# Set labels for the index profile subplot\nax2.set_xlabel('y [mm]')\nax2.set_ylabel('n(y)')\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6— Ray-path inside a SELFOC gradient index optical fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differential form of Fermat’s principle:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nreveals a profound analogy with Newton’s Second Law of motion:\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} = m\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}\\]\nThis comparison, sometimes called “F=ma optics,” illustrates how light rays follow trajectories mathematically similar to those of mechanical particles. To see this connection more clearly, we can expand the ray equation as:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n\\]\nUsing the chain rule, \\(\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\), and denoting \\(\\mathbf{t} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) as the unit tangent vector along the ray:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t} = \\nabla n\\]\nRearranging to isolate the ray curvature term:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\nabla n - (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t}\\]\nThe right side represents the component of \\(\\nabla n\\) perpendicular to the ray direction, which we can denote as \\((\\nabla n)_\\perp\\). Therefore:\n\\[\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\frac{1}{n}(\\nabla n)_\\perp\\]\nThis equation reveals that the ray curvature is proportional to the perpendicular component of the refractive index gradient and inversely proportional to the refractive index itself. Crucially, this shows that light rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, not away from them.\nThis behavior explains many optical phenomena:\n\nLight bending toward the normal when entering a medium with higher refractive index\nLight guiding in optical fibers where light remains confined in the higher-index core\nFormation of mirages where light curves toward the denser air near the ground\nFocusing in gradient-index (GRIN) lenses where the refractive index decreases radially from the center\n\nWhile the mathematical form resembles Newton’s equation for particle motion, the analogy must be carefully interpreted: unlike particles that accelerate toward lower potential energy, light rays curve toward regions of higher refractive index.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Base refractive index (center value)\nn_min = 1.0  # Minimum refractive index (at edges)\nx_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\ny_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)\n\n# Calculate radial distance from center\nR = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)\n# Max radius in our plot\nR_max = 5*np.sqrt(2)\n\n# Create a refractive index profile that decreases with radius\n# but never goes below n_min\ngradient_strength = (n0 - n_min)/R_max  # Calculate appropriate gradient strength\nn = n0 - gradient_strength * R  # Linear decrease with radius\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 10))\n\n# Plot the refractive index as a contour plot\ncontour = ax.contourf(X, Y, n, 20, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.3)\ncbar = fig.colorbar(contour, ax=ax, label='Refractive Index')\n\n# Calculate and plot some ray trajectories\n# We'll simulate the paths by numerical integration\n\ndef ray_path(r0, v0, steps=1000, dt=0.05):\n    \"\"\"Simulate a ray path through the medium\"\"\"\n    r = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    v = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    r[0] = r0\n    v[0] = v0 / np.linalg.norm(v0)  # Normalize velocity\n\n    for i in range(1, steps):\n        # Get position\n        x, y = r[i-1]\n        if abs(x) &gt;= 5 or abs(y) &gt;= 5:\n            return r[:i]\n\n        # Approximate gradient of n at this point\n        eps = 0.01\n        nx_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x+eps)**2 + y**2)\n        nx_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x-eps)**2 + y**2)\n        ny_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y+eps)**2)\n        ny_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y-eps)**2)\n\n        grad_n_x = (nx_plus - nx_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n_y = (ny_plus - ny_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n = np.array([grad_n_x, grad_n_y])\n\n        # Current n value\n        current_n = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n\n        # Calculate the perpendicular component of gradient\n        t = v[i-1] / np.linalg.norm(v[i-1])  # Tangent vector (normalized velocity)\n        grad_n_parallel = np.dot(grad_n, t) * t  # Component along ray direction\n        grad_n_perp = grad_n - grad_n_parallel  # Perpendicular component\n\n        # Update velocity - rays bend toward higher refractive index\n        a = grad_n_perp / current_n\n        v[i] = v[i-1] + a * dt\n        v[i] = v[i] / np.linalg.norm(v[i])  # Ensure unit speed\n\n        # Update position\n        r[i] = r[i-1] + v[i] * dt\n\n    return r\n\n# Calculate several ray paths\nstart_positions = [\n    [-4, 2.5], [-4, 1.5], [-4, 0.5],\n    [-4, -0.5], [-4, -1.5], [-4, -2.5]\n]\npaths = []\n\nfor start_pos in start_positions:\n    path = ray_path(start_pos, [1, 0], steps=500)\n    paths.append(path)\n    ax.plot(path[:, 0], path[:, 1], 'r-', linewidth=1.5)\n\n# Add start points\nfor pos in start_positions:\n    ax.plot(pos[0], pos[1], 'ro')\n\n# Add axis labels\nax.set_xlabel('x position')\nax.set_ylabel('y position')\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-5, 5)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7— F=ma optics - Light rays (red) following paths toward regions of higher refractive index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenses are among the most fundamental optical elements in photonics, using curved surfaces (typically spherical) to manipulate light paths. Understanding how lenses work requires analyzing refraction at spherical surfaces and applying this to the thin lens model.\n\n\nWhen light encounters a spherical boundary between two media, we can analyze its path using Snell’s law and geometric considerations as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8— Refraction at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nTo determine how an image forms, we need to find where rays originating from a point at distance \\(a\\) from the surface will converge after refraction.

This allows us to use linear approximations for trigonometric functions, significantly simplifying calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nTo visualize the validity of this approximation, let’s examine two plots:\n\nThe first plot compares sin(θ) (blue line) with its linear approximation θ (red dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to π/2 radians.\nThe second plot shows the absolute error between sin(θ) and θ.\n\nThese plots demonstrate that:\n\nFor small angles (roughly up to 0.5 radians or about 30 degrees), the approximation is very close to the actual sine function.\nThe error increases rapidly for larger angles, indicating the limitations of the paraxial approximation.\n\nIn most optical systems, especially those involving lenses, the angles of incident and refracted rays are typically small enough for this approximation to be valid. However, it’s important to be aware of its limitations when dealing with wide-angle optical systems or scenarios where precision is critical.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define the range of angles (in radians)\ntheta = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta) and theta (linear approximation)\nsin_theta = np.sin(theta)\nlinear_approx = theta\n\n# Calculate the absolute error\nerror = np.abs(sin_theta - linear_approx)\n\n# Create the plot with two subplots side by side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7.5, 4))\n\n# Plot sin(theta) and theta on the first subplot\nax1.plot(theta, sin_theta, label='sin(θ)', color='blue')\nax1.plot(theta, linear_approx, label='θ', color='red', linestyle='--')\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\sin(x),x$')\nax1.legend()\n\n# Plot the error on the second subplot\nax2.plot(theta, error, label='Absolute Error', color='green')\nax2.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax2.set_ylabel('|sin(θ) - θ|')\nax2.legend()\n\n# Adjust the layout and display the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of the paraxial approximation plotting the \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the linear approximation \\(\\theta\\) (dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the imaging equation, we analyze how light from a point object forms an image after refraction.

The linear relation yields a great opportunity to express optical elements in terms of linear transformations (matrices). This is the basis of matrix optics. The matrix representation of a lens is given by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nwhere the matrix is called the ABCD matrix of the lens. Due to the linearization of Snells law w can write down more generally\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\\n\\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nand one can obtain a Matrix for all types of optical elements such as free space of dustance \\(d\\).\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & d\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nHere are some useful matrices for optical elements:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & d \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Free space}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Planar interface}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{\\left(n_2-n_1\\right)}{n_2 R} & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Spherical Boundary}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Tin Lens}\n\\]\nIf we have now a system of optical elements, we can multiply the matrices of the individual elements to obtain the matrix of the whole system.\n\\[\n\\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}_N \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}=\\mathbf{M}_N \\ldots \\mathrm{M}_2 \\mathbf{M}_1 \\text {. }\n\\]\nThis is a very powerful tool to analyze optical systems.",

    "text": "Light has been described through increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks throughout the history of physics. The simplest framework is Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics, which treats light as rays traveling along straight paths and applies geometrical principles to describe interactions with optical elements like lenses and mirrors. Moving beyond this approximation, Wave Optics introduces the wave nature of light, explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction that ray optics cannot address. Electromagnetic Optics further refines our understanding by treating light as electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell’s equations, providing a complete classical description of light-matter interactions. For intense light sources, Nonlinear Optics becomes essential, describing how materials respond nonlinearly to strong electromagnetic fields, giving rise to frequency conversion and other novel effects. Finally, at the most fundamental level, Quantum Optics treats light as consisting of photons—quantum mechanical particles exhibiting both wave and particle properties—essential for understanding phenomena like spontaneous emission, entanglement, and the quantum nature of light-matter interactions. This course will progressively build your understanding through these increasingly sophisticated frameworks.\n\n\nRay optics, or geometric optics, provides a powerful framework for understanding light propagation when the wavelength is much smaller than the dimensions of optical elements involved. In this approach, light travels along straight lines called rays in homogeneous media, with well-defined paths that can be mathematically traced. This description serves as the foundation for analyzing many optical systems, from simple mirrors to complex microscopes and telescopes.\n\n\nFermat’s Principle forms one of the foundations of ray optics, stating that light travels along the route that takes the total optical path length between any two points to an extremum (commonly a minimum). This optical path length, expressed mathematically as \\(\\int_C n(s)ds\\), represents the effective distance light traverses through media of varying refractive indices. When this quantity is divided by the vacuum speed of light \\(c_0\\), it yields the total travel time required for light to journey between those points.\nIn its integral form:\n\\[\\delta\\int_C n(s)ds = 0\\]\nwhere \\(n(s)\\) is the refractive index along path \\(C\\) and \\(ds\\) is the differential path length.\nThe same principle can be expressed as a differential equation that describes how light bends in media with varying refractive indices:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis equation shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index. In homogeneous media (\\(\\nabla n = 0\\)), it simplifies to \\(\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = 0\\), confirming that light follows straight lines.\n\n\n\nReflection: At a planar interface, Fermat’s Principle directly yields the law of reflection:\n\\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the surface.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_path_length(x, start, end):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)\n    d2 = np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, 3)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate path lengths\npath_lengths = [calculate_path_length(x, start_point, end_point) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(path_lengths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5,alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-')\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start point')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go',  label='end point')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro',  label='reflection Point')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-0.7, -1, \"mirror\")\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Fermat’s principle for reflection of light at an interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reflection at a planar interface, we consider a ray traveling from point A to point B via reflection at point P on a mirror, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-reflection}\\). The total path length is \\(L = |AP| + |PB|\\).\nLet’s establish a coordinate system where the mirror lies along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((-a, h_1)\\) and point B is at \\((b, h_2)\\), with the reflection point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total path length is:\n\\[L(x) = \\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2} + \\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, the actual path minimizes \\(L\\), so we differentiate with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} - \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\]\nNow, let’s interpret this geometrically. The angle of incidence \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle between the incident ray AP and the normal to the mirror (y-axis). Similarly, the angle of reflection \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle between the reflected ray PB and the normal.\nFrom trigonometry:\n\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}}\\)\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_r) = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\)\n\nTherefore, our minimization condition directly yields: \\[\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sin(\\theta_r)\\]\nSince both angles are measured in the same quadrant (from the normal to the mirror), this equality implies: \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nThis is the law of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nLaw of Reflection: The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\n\n\n\nRefraction: Between media with different refractive indices, Fermat’s Principle yields Snell’s law:\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_optical_path(x, start, end, n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total optical path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = n1 * np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)  # Optical path in medium 1\n    d2 = n2 * np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)      # Optical path in medium 2\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, -3)\n\n# Define refractive indices\nn1 = 1.0  # Medium 1 (above interface)\nn2 = 1.5  # Medium 2 (below interface)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate optical path lengths\noptical_paths = [calculate_optical_path(x, start_point, end_point, n1, n2) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(optical_paths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5, alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-', lw=1)\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go', label='end')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro', label='refraction')\n\n# Calculate and draw angles\n# Incident ray\ndx1 = min_x - start_point[0]\ndy1 = 0 - start_point[1]\nincident_angle = np.arctan2(-dy1, dx1)\ntheta1 = np.pi/2 - incident_angle\n\n# Refracted ray\ndx2 = end_point[0] - min_x\ndy2 = end_point[1] - 0\nrefracted_angle = np.arctan2(dy2, dx2)\ntheta2 = np.pi/2 + refracted_angle\n\n# Draw angle arcs\n\n# Add angle labels\nax.text(min_x + 0.3, 0.3, r'$\\theta_1$', color='blue')\nax.text(min_x - 0.5, -0.3, r'$\\theta_2$', color='green')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-3, 0.5, f\"n₁ = {n1}\", color='blue')\nax.text(-3, -0.5, f\"n₂ = {n2}\", color='green')\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Snell’s Law from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefraction Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor refraction between two media with different refractive indices, we apply Fermat’s principle to find the path that minimizes the total optical path length. Consider a ray traveling from point A in medium 1 to point B in medium 2, with refraction occurring at point P on the interface, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-refraction}\\).\nThe total optical path length is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nTo determine the exact refraction point P that minimizes this path, we establish a coordinate system with the interface along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((x_A, y_A)\\) where \\(y_A &gt; 0\\), and point B is at \\((x_B, y_B)\\) where \\(y_B &lt; 0\\), with the refraction point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total optical path length is:\n\\[L(x) = n_1\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2} + n_2\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, we minimize \\(L\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(x\\) and setting it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1\\frac{x-x_A}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} - n_2\\frac{x_B-x}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1(x-x_A)}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} = \\frac{n_2(x_B-x)}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\]\nFrom geometry, we can identify the sine of the angles of incidence and refraction:\n\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{|AP|} = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}}\\)\n\\(\\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{|PB|} = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\)\n\nTaking the sign into account based on our coordinate system, our minimization condition becomes:\n\\[n_1\\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2\\sin(\\theta_2)\\]\nThis is Snell’s law, stating that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\nSnell’s Law: The ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the reciprocal of the ratio of the refractive indices. \\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef snell(n1, n2, theta1):\n    sin_theta2 = n1 * np.sin(theta1) / n2\n    theta2 = np.arcsin(np.clip(sin_theta2, -1, 1))\n    theta2[sin_theta2 &gt; 1] = np.nan\n    return theta2\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))\n\ntheta1 = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\ntheta2_1_to_1_5 = snell(1.0, 1.5, theta1)\ntheta2_1_5_to_1 = snell(1.5, 1.0, theta1)\ntheta2_1_to_1 = snell(1.0, 1.0, theta1)\n\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1_5), color='blue')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_5_to_1), color='red')\nax.plot(np.degrees(theta1), np.degrees(theta2_1_to_1), color='green', linestyle='--')\n\nax.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta_1$ [°]')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\theta_2$ [°]')\nax.set_xlim(0, 90)\nax.set_ylim(0, 90)\n\nax.plot([0, 90], [0, 90], color='gray', linestyle=':', label='y=x')\n\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1.5$', xy=(60, 35), xytext=(50, 20),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='blue')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_1}{n_2}=1.5$', xy=(30, 50), xytext=(10, 70),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='red')\nax.annotate(r'$\\frac{n_2}{n_1}=1$', xy=(45, 45), xytext=(65, 50),\n            arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;'), color='green')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Snell’s law for different combinations of refractive indices. The plots show the relationship between incident angle (\\(\\theta_1\\)) and refracted angle (\\(\\theta_2\\)) for three scenarios: (a) light passing from air to glass, (b) light passing from glass to air, and (c) a comparison of both cases. Note how the curves differ when light moves into a medium with higher refractive index versus a lower refractive index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index (\\(n_1\\)) to one with a lower refractive index (\\(n_2\\)), a fascinating phenomenon can occur. As the angle of incidence increases, the refracted ray bends away from the normal until, at a critical angle, it travels along the boundary between the two media. Beyond this critical angle, light can no longer pass into the second medium and is instead completely reflected back into the first medium. This phenomenon is known as total internal reflection (TIR).\nFrom Snell’s law, the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\) occurs when the refracted angle \\(\\theta_2 = 90°\\):\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_c = n_2\\sin(90°) = n_2\\]\nTherefore:\n\\[\\theta_c = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{n_2}{n_1}\\right)\\]\nFor total internal reflection to occur, two conditions must be satisfied:\n\nLight must travel from a higher to a lower refractive index medium (\\(n_1 &gt; n_2\\))\nThe angle of incidence must exceed the critical angle (\\(\\theta_1 &gt; \\theta_c\\))\n\nFrom Fermat’s principle perspective, total internal reflection represents a scenario where no physical path through the second medium can satisfy the minimum optical path length requirement. Instead, the path of least time becomes the reflected path within the original medium. This phenomenon has numerous practical applications, including:\n\nFiber optic communication: Light signals travel long distances through optical fibers via successive total internal reflections with minimal loss\nPrisms and reflectors: Total internal reflection in prisms provides perfect reflection without needing reflective coatings\nGemstones: The brilliance of diamonds results from light being trapped through multiple internal reflections\nOptical instruments: Binoculars, periscopes, and endoscopes use prisms with TIR to redirect light\n\nTotal internal reflection demonstrates how Fermat’s principle enforces an absolute constraint on light’s behavior—when no path through the second medium can minimize the optical path length, light must remain in the first medium, following the path of least time.\nOptical Fibers and Total Internal Reflection\nTotal internal reflection plays a crucial role in modern telecommunications, particularly in optical fibers, which are also part of many experimental setups. These fibers are essentially ultra-thin glass wires, ranging in diameter from a few micrometers to several hundred micrometers, designed to transport light over long distances with minimal loss.\nThe structure of an optical fiber is key to its function:\n\nCore: A central glass core with a refractive index \\(n_1\\)\nCladding: A surrounding layer with a slightly lower refractive index \\(n_2\\)\n\nThis difference in refractive indices is what allows total internal reflection to occur within the fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4— Total internal reflection in an optical fiber.\n\n\n\nFor light to propagate effectively through the fiber, it must enter at an angle that ensures total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface. This leads to the concept of the acceptance angle, \\(\\theta_a\\), which is the maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still undergo total internal reflection.\nTo characterize this acceptance angle, optical engineers use a parameter called the Numerical Aperture (NA).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Aperture\n\n\n\nThe Numerical Aperture of a fiber is defined as the sine of the maximum acceptance angle:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sin(\\theta_a) = \\sqrt{n_1^2 - n_2^2}\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\nThis equation relates the NA directly to the refractive indices of the core and cladding. The derivation of this formula involves applying Snell’s law at the air-fiber interface and at the core-cladding interface, then using the condition for total internal reflection.\nIn practice, typical values for the refractive indices might be \\(n_1 = 1.475\\) for the core and \\(n_2 = 1.46\\) for the cladding. Plugging these into our equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nNA = \\sqrt{1.475^2 - 1.46^2} \\approx 0.2\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThis means that light entering the fiber within a cone of about 11.5° (arcsin(0.2)) from the fiber’s axis will be transmitted through the fiber via total internal reflection.\nThe NA is an important parameter in fiber optic design:\n\nIt determines the light-gathering ability of the fiber.\nIt affects the fiber’s bandwidth and its susceptibility to certain types of signal distortion.\nIt influences how easily the fiber can be coupled to light sources and other fibers.\n\nOptical fibers come in various types, each optimized for different applications. Some fibers are designed to transmit light over long distances with minimal loss, while others are engineered for specific wavelengths or to guide light in unusual ways. The figure below shows a few examples of optical fiber types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5— Rendering of different optical fibers types (from left to right): Hollow core optical fiber, hollow core bragg fiber, photonic crystal fiber, conventional fiber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the differential ray equation from Fermat’s integral principle, we apply the calculus of variations. Starting with the optical path length functional:\n\\[L = \\int_C n(s)ds = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\) parametrizes the path. The term \\(\\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right|\\) represents the differential element of arc length \\(ds\\) along the path, so \\(ds = \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\). This parametrization allows us to convert the path integral over the curve \\(C\\) into a definite integral over the parameter \\(t\\). According to Fermat’s principle, the true path makes this integral stationary (δL = 0).\nConsider a small variation in the path: \\(\\mathbf{r}(t) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)\\) where \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}(t_1) = \\mathbf{\\eta}(t_2) = 0\\) (fixed endpoints).

Let me demonstrate how Fermat’s principle can be used to determine the ray paths in these fibers. A SELFOC fiber has a radially varying refractive index, typically following a parabolic profile:\n\\[n(r) = n_0\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 r^2\\right)\\]\nwhere: - \\(n_0\\) is the refractive index at the central axis - \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the axis - \\(\\alpha\\) is the gradient constant that determines how quickly the index decreases with radius\n\n\nFor a medium with a spatially varying refractive index, Fermat’s principle states that light follows the path that minimizes the optical path length:\n\\[\\delta \\int_C n(r) ds = 0\\]\nThis yields the differential equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\n\n\n\nFor our parabolic index profile, the gradient of the refractive index is:\n\\[\\nabla n = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -n_0\\alpha^2 r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\]\nUsing cylindrical coordinates with z along the fiber axis, and assuming the paraxial approximation (rays make small angles with the z-axis), we can simplify the ray equation to:\n\\[\\frac{d^2r}{dz^2} + \\alpha^2 r = 0\\]\nThis is the equation for a harmonic oscillator, which has the solution:\n\\[r(z) = r_0 \\cos(\\alpha z) + \\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha} \\sin(\\alpha z)\\]\nwhere \\(r_0\\) is the initial radial position and \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the ray with respect to the fiber axis.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Central refractive index\nalpha = 0.3  # Gradient constant (mm^-1)\nlength = 30  # Length of fiber (mm)\nradius = 1.5  # Radius of fiber (mm)\n\n# Create a grid for visualization\nz = np.linspace(0, length, 300)\nr_grid = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\nZ, R = np.meshgrid(z, r_grid)\n\n# Calculate refractive index at each point\nN = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * R)**2)\n\n# Initialize ray paths\nr0_values = [0.6, 1.0, 1.4]  # Initial radial positions\ntheta0_values = [0, 0.2, -0.2]    # Initial angles (all parallel to axis)\n\n# Plot setup\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(15, 5), gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [3, 1]})\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile in the first subplot\ncmap = plt.cm.viridis\nextent = [0, length, -radius, radius]\nim = ax1.imshow(np.vstack((N[::-1], N)), extent=extent,\n               aspect='auto', cmap=cmap, origin='lower',alpha=0.2)\nfig.colorbar(im, ax=ax1, label='n(y)')\n\n# Plot ray paths\nfor r0, theta0 in zip(r0_values, theta0_values):\n    # Calculate ray path\n    r = r0 * np.cos(alpha * z) + (theta0/alpha) * np.sin(alpha * z)\n\n    # Plot ray path\n    ax1.plot(z, r, 'r-')\n    ax1.plot(z, -r, 'r-')  # Symmetric ray below axis\n\n# Add labels and title for first subplot\nax1.set_xlabel('z [mm]')\nax1.set_ylabel('y [mm]')\n\n# For the right subplot, plot r-position vs refractive index\n# Create a finer array of radial positions for a smooth curve\nr_positions = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\n# Calculate refractive index at each radial position\nn_profile = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * r_positions)**2)\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile\nax2.plot( n_profile,r_positions, 'k-')\nax2.plot( n_profile,-r_positions, 'k-')\n\n# Set labels for the index profile subplot\nax2.set_xlabel('y [mm]')\nax2.set_ylabel('n(y)')\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6— Ray-path inside a SELFOC gradient index optical fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differential form of Fermat’s principle:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nreveals a profound analogy with Newton’s Second Law of motion:\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} = m\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}\\]\nThis comparison, sometimes called “F=ma optics,” illustrates how light rays follow trajectories mathematically similar to those of mechanical particles. To see this connection more clearly, we can expand the ray equation as:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n\\]\nUsing the chain rule, \\(\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\), and denoting \\(\\mathbf{t} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) as the unit tangent vector along the ray:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t} = \\nabla n\\]\nRearranging to isolate the ray curvature term:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\nabla n - (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t}\\]\nThe right side represents the component of \\(\\nabla n\\) perpendicular to the ray direction, which we can denote as \\((\\nabla n)_\\perp\\). Therefore:\n\\[\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\frac{1}{n}(\\nabla n)_\\perp\\]\nThis equation reveals that the ray curvature is proportional to the perpendicular component of the refractive index gradient and inversely proportional to the refractive index itself. Crucially, this shows that light rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, not away from them.\nThis behavior explains many optical phenomena:\n\nLight bending toward the normal when entering a medium with higher refractive index\nLight guiding in optical fibers where light remains confined in the higher-index core\nFormation of mirages where light curves toward the denser air near the ground\nFocusing in gradient-index (GRIN) lenses where the refractive index decreases radially from the center\n\nWhile the mathematical form resembles Newton’s equation for particle motion, the analogy must be carefully interpreted: unlike particles that accelerate toward lower potential energy, light rays curve toward regions of higher refractive index.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Base refractive index (center value)\nn_min = 1.0  # Minimum refractive index (at edges)\nx_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\ny_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)\n\n# Calculate radial distance from center\nR = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)\n# Max radius in our plot\nR_max = 5*np.sqrt(2)\n\n# Create a refractive index profile that decreases with radius\n# but never goes below n_min\ngradient_strength = (n0 - n_min)/R_max  # Calculate appropriate gradient strength\nn = n0 - gradient_strength * R  # Linear decrease with radius\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 10))\n\n# Plot the refractive index as a contour plot\ncontour = ax.contourf(X, Y, n, 20, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.3)\ncbar = fig.colorbar(contour, ax=ax, label='Refractive Index')\n\n# Calculate and plot some ray trajectories\n# We'll simulate the paths by numerical integration\n\ndef ray_path(r0, v0, steps=1000, dt=0.05):\n    \"\"\"Simulate a ray path through the medium\"\"\"\n    r = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    v = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    r[0] = r0\n    v[0] = v0 / np.linalg.norm(v0)  # Normalize velocity\n\n    for i in range(1, steps):\n        # Get position\n        x, y = r[i-1]\n        if abs(x) &gt;= 5 or abs(y) &gt;= 5:\n            return r[:i]\n\n        # Approximate gradient of n at this point\n        eps = 0.01\n        nx_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x+eps)**2 + y**2)\n        nx_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x-eps)**2 + y**2)\n        ny_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y+eps)**2)\n        ny_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y-eps)**2)\n\n        grad_n_x = (nx_plus - nx_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n_y = (ny_plus - ny_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n = np.array([grad_n_x, grad_n_y])\n\n        # Current n value\n        current_n = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n\n        # Calculate the perpendicular component of gradient\n        t = v[i-1] / np.linalg.norm(v[i-1])  # Tangent vector (normalized velocity)\n        grad_n_parallel = np.dot(grad_n, t) * t  # Component along ray direction\n        grad_n_perp = grad_n - grad_n_parallel  # Perpendicular component\n\n        # Update velocity - rays bend toward higher refractive index\n        a = grad_n_perp / current_n\n        v[i] = v[i-1] + a * dt\n        v[i] = v[i] / np.linalg.norm(v[i])  # Ensure unit speed\n\n        # Update position\n        r[i] = r[i-1] + v[i] * dt\n\n    return r\n\n# Calculate several ray paths\nstart_positions = [\n    [-4, 2.5], [-4, 1.5], [-4, 0.5],\n    [-4, -0.5], [-4, -1.5], [-4, -2.5]\n]\npaths = []\n\nfor start_pos in start_positions:\n    path = ray_path(start_pos, [1, 0], steps=500)\n    paths.append(path)\n    ax.plot(path[:, 0], path[:, 1], 'r-', linewidth=1.5)\n\n# Add start points\nfor pos in start_positions:\n    ax.plot(pos[0], pos[1], 'ro')\n\n# Add axis labels\nax.set_xlabel('x position')\nax.set_ylabel('y position')\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-5, 5)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7— F=ma optics - Light rays (red) following paths toward regions of higher refractive index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLenses are among the most fundamental optical elements in photonics, using curved surfaces (typically spherical) to manipulate light paths. Understanding how lenses work requires analyzing refraction at spherical surfaces and applying this to the thin lens model.\n\n\nWhen light encounters a spherical boundary between two media, we can analyze its path using Snell’s law and geometric considerations as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8— Refraction at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nTo determine how an image forms, we need to find where rays originating from a point at distance \\(a\\) from the surface will converge after refraction. Using Snell’s law for a ray hitting the surface at angle \\(\\alpha+\\theta_1\\):\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWhere: \\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nFor practical optical systems, we employ the paraxial approximation, where all angles are assumed small enough that:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta+ O(\\theta^{3}), \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta + O(\\theta^{3}),\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1 + O(\\theta^{2})\\]\nThis simplifies Snell’s law to:\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nAfter appropriate transformations (detailed in the online lecture), we obtain:\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1\\]\nThis linear relationship between input (\\(y\\), \\(\\theta_1\\)) and output (\\(\\theta_2\\)) parameters is a hallmark of paraxial optics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParaxial Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paraxial approximation is a fundamental simplification in optics that assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use linear approximations for trigonometric functions, significantly simplifying calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nTo visualize the validity of this approximation, let’s examine two plots:\n\nThe first plot compares sin(θ) (blue line) with its linear approximation θ (red dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to π/2 radians.\nThe second plot shows the absolute error between sin(θ) and θ.\n\nThese plots demonstrate that:\n\nFor small angles (roughly up to 0.5 radians or about 30 degrees), the approximation is very close to the actual sine function.\nThe error increases rapidly for larger angles, indicating the limitations of the paraxial approximation.\n\nIn most optical systems, especially those involving lenses, the angles of incident and refracted rays are typically small enough for this approximation to be valid. However, it’s important to be aware of its limitations when dealing with wide-angle optical systems or scenarios where precision is critical.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define the range of angles (in radians)\ntheta = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta) and theta (linear approximation)\nsin_theta = np.sin(theta)\nlinear_approx = theta\n\n# Calculate the absolute error\nerror = np.abs(sin_theta - linear_approx)\n\n# Create the plot with two subplots side by side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7.5, 4))\n\n# Plot sin(theta) and theta on the first subplot\nax1.plot(theta, sin_theta, label='sin(θ)', color='blue')\nax1.plot(theta, linear_approx, label='θ', color='red', linestyle='--')\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\sin(x),x$')\nax1.legend()\n\n# Plot the error on the second subplot\nax2.plot(theta, error, label='Absolute Error', color='green')\nax2.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax2.set_ylabel('|sin(θ) - θ|')\nax2.legend()\n\n# Adjust the layout and display the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of the paraxial approximation plotting the \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the linear approximation \\(\\theta\\) (dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the imaging equation, we analyze how light from a point object forms an image after refraction.

A ray parallel to the optical axis, which passes through the far focal point after refraction 2. A ray through the center of the lens, which passes undeflected 3.

Consider a spherical boundary between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). We’ll place our coordinate system so that the spherical surface intersects the x-axis at x=0, with radius R and its center at position (R,0) to the right.\nFor a point P on the spherical surface at height y from the optical axis, the total optical path length from object point A at (-a,0) to image point B at (b,0) is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nwhere: \\[|AP| = \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}\\] \\[|PB| = \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, light follows the path where this length is stationary:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dy} = n_1\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} + n_2\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = 0\\]\nComputing these derivatives:\n\\[\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|AP|}\\] \\[\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|PB|}\\]\nSubstituting into our condition:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = 0\\]\nThis equation is incorrect. The right-hand side should not be zero because we need to account for the geometry of the spherical surface. The correct form includes the effect of the surface normal:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = \\frac{(n_2-n_1)y}{R}\\]\nThis correction comes from the fact that at point P, the normal to the spherical surface makes an angle α with the optical axis, where sin(α) ≈ y/R in the paraxial approximation.\nDividing by y (assuming y≠0):\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{|AP|} + \\frac{n_2}{|PB|} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nIn the paraxial approximation, we can use |AP| ≈ a and |PB| ≈ b, yielding:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a} + \\frac{n_2}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nThis is the correct imaging equation for a spherical refracting surface.\nThe elegance of Fermat’s principle is preserved, as it still naturally produces the same result as our geometric derivation, once we properly account for the geometry of the refracting surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving the Thin Lens Equation from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the thin lens equation, we apply Fermat’s principle to the two spherical surfaces that make up a lens. Consider a lens with refractive index \\(n_2\\) in a medium of index \\(n_1\\), with surface radii \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\).\nThe total optical path for a ray passing through the lens at height \\(y\\) from the optical axis is: - Path from object to first surface: \\(n_1 s_1\\) - Path through the lens: \\(n_2 s_2\\) - Path from second surface to image: \\(n_1 s_3\\)\nFor a thin lens, the optical path length simplifies to:\n\\[L(y) = n_1 \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2} + n_2 d(y) + n_1 \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nWhere \\(d(y)\\) is the thickness of the lens at height \\(y\\), which can be approximated as:\n\\[d(y) \\approx d_0 + \\frac{y^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)\\]\nApplying Fermat’s principle (\\(\\frac{dL}{dy} = 0\\)) and using the paraxial approximation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}} = 0\\]\nIn the paraxial limit (\\(y \\ll a, y \\ll b\\)), this becomes:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{a} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{b} = 0\\]\nDividing by \\(y\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis is the thin lens equation with the focal length given by the lensmaker’s equation:\n\\[f = \\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left(\\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2-R_1}\\right)\\]\nThus, both the imaging equation and the lensmaker equation emerge naturally from Fermat’s principle applied to the geometry of a thin lens, showing that light follows paths of equal optical length from object to image when passing through any part of the lens.\nFrom a wave perspective, what makes a lens focus light to a point is that all paths from object to image through any part of the lens have equal optical path lengths (to first order in the paraxial approximation), ensuring constructive interference at the image point.",

    "text": "Interference is a fundamental physical phenomenon that demonstrates the superposition principle for linear systems. This principle, which states that the net response to multiple stimuli is the sum of the individual responses, is central to our understanding of wave physics. Interference appears across many domains of physics: in optics where it enables high-precision measurements and holography, in quantum mechanics where it reveals the wave nature of matter, and in acoustics where it forms the basis for noise cancellation technology. The ability of waves to interfere constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively (canceling each other) has profound practical applications, from the anti-reflective coatings on optical elements to the operational principles of interferometric gravitational wave detectors like LIGO. Understanding interference is therefore not just of theoretical interest but crucial for modern technology and experimental physics.\nWhen two wave solutions \\(U_1(\\mathbf{r})\\) and \\(U_2(\\mathbf{r})\\) combine, their superposition gives:\n\\[\nU(\\mathbf{r})=U_1(\\mathbf{r})+U_2(\\mathbf{r})\n\\]\nThe resulting intensity is:\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\nI &= &|U|^2\\\\\n&= &|U_1+U_2|^2\\\\\n&= &|U_1|^2+|U_2|^2+U^{*}_1 U_2 + U_1 U^{*}_2\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nThe individual wave intensities are given by \\(I_1=|U_1|^2\\) and \\(I_2=|U_2|^2\\). Using this, we can express each complex wave amplitude in polar form, separating its magnitude (related to intensity) and phase:\n\\[\nU_1=\\sqrt{I_1}e^{i\\phi_1}\n\\] \\[\nU_2=\\sqrt{I_2}e^{i\\phi_2}\n\\]\nSubstituting these expressions back into our interference equation and performing the algebra, the total intensity becomes:\n\\[\nI=I_1+I_2+2\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\\cos(\\Delta \\phi)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta \\phi=\\phi_2-\\phi_1\\) is the phase difference between the waves. This equation is known as the interference formula and contains three terms:\n\n\\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\): the individual intensities\n\\(2\\sqrt{I_1 I_2}\\cos(\\Delta \\phi)\\): the interference term that can be positive or negative\n\nA particularly important special case occurs when the interfering waves have equal intensities (\\(I_1=I_2=I_0\\)). The equation then simplifies to:\n\\[\nI=2I_0(1+\\cos(\\Delta \\phi))=4I_0\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta \\phi}{2}\\right)\n\\]\nThis last form clearly shows that:\n\nMaximum intensity (\\(4I_0\\)) occurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi n\\) (constructive interference)\nZero intensity occurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi = (2n+1)\\pi\\) (destructive interference)\nThe intensity varies sinusoidally with the phase difference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive Interference\n\n\n\nOccurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi m\\) (where \\(m\\) is an integer), resulting in \\(I=4I_0\\)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nx=np.linspace(0,2,1000)\nwavelength=0.532\nk=2*np.pi/0.532\ny1=np.cos(k*x)\n\nfig,[ax1,ax2,ax3]=plt.subplots(3,1,figsize=get_size(10,8))\nax1.plot(x/wavelength,y1,label='Wave 1')\nax2.plot(x/wavelength,y1,label='Wave 1')\nax3.plot(x/wavelength,2*y1,label='Wave 1')\nax3.set_xlabel(r\"distance [$\\lambda$]\")\nax1.set_ylabel(r\"$U_1$\")\nax2.set_ylabel(r\"$U_2$\")\nax3.set_ylabel(r\"$U_1+U_2$\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nConstructive interference of two waves (top, middle) and the sum of the two wave amplitudes (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive Interference\n\n\n\nOccurs when \\(\\Delta \\phi=(2m-1)\\pi\\) (where \\(m\\) is an integer), resulting in \\(I=0\\)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nx=np.linspace(0,2,1000)\nwavelength=0.532\nk=2*np.pi/0.532\ny1=np.cos(k*x)\ny2=np.cos(k*x+np.pi)\n\nfig,[ax1,ax2,ax3]=plt.subplots(3,1,figsize=get_size(10,8))\nax1.plot(x/wavelength,y1,label='Wave 1')\nax2.plot(x/wavelength,y2,label='Wave 1')\nax3.plot(x/wavelength,y1+y2,label='Wave 1')\nax3.set_xlabel(r\"distance [$\\lambda$]\")\nax1.set_ylabel(r\"$U_1$\")\nax2.set_ylabel(r\"$U_2$\")\nax3.set_ylabel(r\"$U_1+U_2$\")\nax3.set_ylim(-1,1)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive interference of two waves (top, middle) and the sum of the two wave amplitudes (bottom)\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase and Path Difference\nThe phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) can be related to the path difference \\(\\Delta s\\) between the two waves. For two waves with the same frequency \\(\\omega\\), we can write their complete phase expressions as:\n\\[\\phi_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{k}_1\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t + \\phi_{01}\\] \\[\\phi_2(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\mathbf{k}_2\\cdot\\mathbf{r} - \\omega t + \\phi_{02}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\mathbf{k}_i\\) are the wave vectors\n\\(\\mathbf{r}\\) is the position vector\n\\(\\omega\\) is the angular frequency\n\\(\\phi_{0i}\\) are initial phase constants\n\nThe instantaneous phase difference is then:\n\\[\n\\Delta\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\phi_2(\\mathbf{r},t) - \\phi_1(\\mathbf{r},t) = (\\mathbf{k}_2-\\mathbf{k}_1)\\cdot\\mathbf{r} + (\\phi_{02}-\\phi_{01})\n\\]\nFor stationary interference patterns, we typically observe the time-independent phase difference. When the waves travel along similar paths (same direction), this reduces to:\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = k\\Delta s + \\Delta\\phi_0\\]\nwhere \\(\\Delta s\\) is the path difference and \\(\\Delta\\phi_0\\) is any initial phase difference between the sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase Difference and Path Difference\n\n\n\nA path difference \\(\\Delta s\\) corresponds to a phase difference \\(k\\Delta s=2\\pi\\Delta s/\\lambda\\). Path differences of integer multiples of \\(\\lambda\\) result in phase differences of integer multiples of \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n\n\n\nInterference of Waves in Space\n\n\nCode\ndef plane_wave(k,omega,r,t):\n    return(np.exp(1j*(np.dot(k,r)-omega*t)))\n\nwavelength=532e-9\nk0=2*np.pi/wavelength\nc=299792458\nomega0=k0*c\n\nvec=np.array([0.0,0.,1.])\nvec1=np.array([1.0,0.,1.])\nvec=vec/np.sqrt(np.dot(vec,vec))\nvec1=vec1/np.sqrt(np.dot(vec1,vec1))\n\nk=k0*vec\nk1=k0*vec1\n\nx=np.linspace(-2.5e-6,2.5e-6,300)\nz=np.linspace(0,5e-6,300)\n\nX,Z=np.meshgrid(x,z)\nr=np.array([X,0,Z],dtype=object)\n\nfig,ax=plt.subplots(2,2,figsize=get_size(10,10))\nfield=plane_wave(k,omega0,r,0)\nfield1=plane_wave(k1,omega0,r,0)\n\nextent = np.min(z)*1e6, np.max(z)*1e6,np.min(x)*1e6, np.max(x)*1e6\nax[0,0].imshow(np.real(field.transpose()),extent=extent,vmin=-1,vmax=1,cmap='seismic')\nax[0,0].set_title('wave 1')\nax[0,1].imshow(np.real(field1.transpose()),extent=extent,vmin=-1,vmax=1,cmap='seismic')\nax[0,1].set_title('wave 2')\nax[1,0].imshow(np.real(field.transpose()+field1.transpose()),extent=extent,vmin=-1,vmax=1,cmap='seismic')\nax[1,0].set_title('sum')\nax[1,1].imshow(np.abs(field.transpose()+field1.transpose())**2,extent=extent,cmap='gray')\nax[1,1].set_title('intensity')\nax[1,1].set_xlabel('z-position [µm]')\nax[1,0].set_xlabel('z-position [µm]')\nax[1,0].set_ylabel('x-position [µm]')\nax[0,0].set_ylabel('x-position [µm]')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nInterference of two plane waves propagating under an angle of 45°.

The top graphs show the original waves. The two bottom show the total amplitude and the intensity pattern.\n\n\n\n\nThe interference of the spherical and the plane wave (also the one of the two plane waves) give also an interesting result. The intensity resembles to be a snapshot of the shape of the wavefronts of the spherical wave. We can therefore measure the wavefronts of the spherical wave by interfering it with a plane wave. This is also the basic principle behind holography. There we use a reference wave to interfere with the wave that we want to measure. The interference pattern is recorded and can be used to reconstruct the wavefronts of the wave.\n\nA super nice website to try out interference interactively is here.\n\n\n\nCoherence\nIn the earlier consideration we obtained a general description for the phase difference between two waves. TIt is given by and contains the pathlength difference \\(\\Delta s\\) and some intrinsic phase \\(\\Delta\\phi_0\\) that could be part of the wave generation process.\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = k\\Delta s + \\Delta\\phi_0\\]\nTo observe stationary interference, it is important that these two quantities are also stationary, i.e. the phase relation between the two waves is stationary. This relation between the phase of two waves is called coherence and was assumed in all the examples before.\n\n\n\nTwo waves of different frequency over time.\n\n\nThe above image shows the timetrace of the amplitude of two wave with slightly different frequency. Due to the frequency, the waves run out of phase and have acquired a phase different of \\(\\pi\\) after \\(40\\) fs.\nThe temporal coherence of two waves is now defined by the time it takes for the two waves to obtain a phase difference of \\(2\\pi\\). The phase difference between two wave of frequency \\(\\nu_1\\) and \\(\\nu_2\\) is given by\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi (\\nu_2-\\nu_1)(t-t_0)\n\\]\nHere \\(t_0\\) refers to the time, when thw two waves were perfectly in sync. Lets assume that the two frequencies are seperarated from a central frequency \\(\\nu_0\\) such that\n\\[\n\\nu_1=\\nu_0-\\Delta \\nu/2\n\\] \\[\n\\nu_2=\\nu_0+\\Delta \\nu/2\n\\]\nInserting this into the first equation yields\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi \\Delta \\nu \\Delta t\n\\]\nwith \\(\\Delta t=t-t_0\\). We can now define the coherence time as the time interval over which the phase shift \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) grows to \\(2\\pi\\), i.e. \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi\\). The coherence time is thus\n\\[\n\\tau_{c}=\\Delta t =\\frac{1}{\\Delta \\nu}\n\\]\nThus the temporal coherence and the frequency distribution of the light are intrisincly connected. Monochromatic light has \\(\\Delta nu=0\\) and thus the coherence time is infinitely long. Light with a wide spectrum (white light for example) therefore has and extremly short coherence time.\nThe coherence time is also connected to a coherence length. The coherence length \\(L_c\\) is given by the distance light travels within the coherence time \\(\\tau_c\\), i.e.\n\\[\nL_c=c\\tau_c\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoherence\n\n\n\nTwo waves are called coherent, if they exihibit a fixed phase relation in space or time relation over time. It measures their ability to interfer. The main types of coherence are\n\nTemporal Coherence\n\nMeasures phase correlation of a wave with itself at different times\nCharacterized by coherence time \\(\\tau_c\\) and coherence length \\(L_c = c\\tau_c\\)\nRelated to spectral width: \\(\\tau_c = 1/\\Delta\\nu\\)\nPerfect for monochromatic waves (single frequency)\nLimited for broad spectrum sources (like thermal light)\n\n\n\nSpatial Coherence\n\nMeasures phase correlation between different points in space\nImportant for interference from extended sources\nDetermines ability to form interference patterns\nRelated to source size and geometry\n\nCoherence is a property of the light source and is connected to the frequency distribution of the light. Sources can be:\n\nFully coherent: ideal laser\nPartially coherent: real laser\nIncoherent: thermal light\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore General Description of Coherence\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the above definition provides an intuitive picture based on frequency spread, we can describe coherence more rigorously using correlation functions. These functions measure how well a wave maintains its phase relationships:\nIn real physical systems, perfect coherence (constant phase relationship) between waves is rare. Partial coherence describes the degree to which waves maintain a consistent phase relationship over time and space. We can characterize this using correlation functions:\n\nTemporal Coherence The complex degree of temporal coherence is given by:\n\n\\[g^{(1)}(\\tau) = \\frac{\\langle U(t)U^*(t+\\tau)\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle|U(t)|^2\\rangle\\langle|U(t+\\tau)|^2\\rangle}}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(\\tau\\) is the time delay\n\\(U(t)\\) is the electric field\n\\(\\langle...\\rangle\\) denotes time averaging\n\n\nSpatial Coherence Similarly, spatial coherence between two points is characterized by:\n\n\\[g^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r}_1,\\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{\\langle U(\\mathbf{r}_1)U^*(\\mathbf{r}_2)\\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle|U(\\mathbf{r}_1)|^2\\rangle\\langle|U(\\mathbf{r}_2)|^2\\rangle}}\\]\nThe obtained correlation functions can be used to calculate the coherence time and length and have the following properties:\n\n\\(|g^{(1)}| = 1\\) indicates perfect coherence\n\\(|g^{(1)}| = 0\\) indicates complete incoherence\n\\(0 &lt; |g^{(1)}| &lt; 1\\) indicates partial coherence\n\nA finite coherence time and length is leads to partial coherence affects interference visibility through:\n\nReduced contrast in interference patterns\nLimited coherence length/area\nSpectral broadening\n\n\n\nCode\nomega0 = 2.0\ndelta_omega = 0.05  # frequency difference\ntau_c = np.pi/delta_omega  # coherence time (corrected)\nbeat_period = 2*np.pi/delta_omega  # time for full beat cycle\n\nt = np.linspace(0, 1000, 10000)\ntau = np.linspace(0, 500, 200)\n\ndef generate_waves(t):\n    wave1 = np.exp(1j * omega0 * t)\n    wave2 = np.exp(1j * (omega0 + delta_omega) * t)\n    return wave1, wave2\n\ndef calc_correlation(wave, tau):\n    g = np.zeros(len(tau), dtype=complex)\n    N = len(wave)\n\n    for i, dt in enumerate(tau):\n        shift = int(dt * 10)\n        if shift &gt;= N:\n            g[i] = 0\n        else:\n            g[i] = np.mean(wave[:(N-shift)] * np.conj(wave[shift:]))\n\n    return g / np.abs(g[0])\n\n\nwave1, wave2 = generate_waves(t)\nwave_total = wave1 + wave2\n\n# Calculate correlation\ng = calc_correlation(wave_total, tau)\n\n# Plot\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=get_size(10, 8))\n\n# Plot waves\nax1.plot(t[:500], np.real(wave1[:500]), label='Wave 1', alpha=0.7)\nax1.plot(t[:500], np.real(wave2[:500]), label='Wave 2', alpha=0.7)\nax1.plot(t[:500], np.real(wave_total[:500]), 'k', label='Sum', alpha=0.7,lw=0.5)\nax1.set_title('wave superposition')\nax1.set_xlabel('time')\nax1.set_ylabel('amplitude')\nax1.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')\n\n\n# Plot correlation\nax2.plot(tau, np.abs(g))\nax2.axvline(x=tau_c, color='r', linestyle='--', label=r'$\\tau_c$ ')\nax2.axvline(x=beat_period, color='g', linestyle=':', label=f'Beat period')\nax2.set_title('|g⁽¹⁾(τ)|')\nax2.set_xlabel('τ')\nax2.set_ylabel('|g⁽¹⁾(τ)|')\nax2.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.subplots_adjust(right=0.85)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nTemporal correlation for two waves with slightly different frequencies.

Commonly there will be a multitude of partial waves contribute to the oberved intereference. This is what we would like to have a look at now. We will do that in a quite general fashion, as the resulting formulas will appear several times again for different problems.\nNevertheless we will make a difference between\n\nmultiwave interference of waves with the constant amplitude\nmultiwave interference of waves with decreasing amplitude\n\nEspecially the latter is often occuring, if we have multiple reflections and each reflection is only a fraction of the incident amplitude.\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference with Constant Amplitude\nIn the case of constant amplitude (for example realized by a grating, which we talk about later), the total wave amplitude is given according to the picture below by\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_1+U_3+\\ldots+U_M\n\\]\nwhere we sum the amplitude over \\(M\\) partial waves. Between the neighboring waves (e.g. \\(U_1\\) and \\(U_2\\)), we will assume a phase difference (because of a path length difference for example), which we denote as \\(\\Delta \\phi\\).\nThe amplitude of the p-th wave is then given by\n\\[\nU_p=\\sqrt{I_0}e^{i(p-1)\\Delta \\phi}\n\\]\nwith the index \\(p\\) being an interger \\(p=1,2,\\ldots,M\\), \\(h=e^{i\\Delta \\phi}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\) as the amplitude of each individual wave. The total amplitude \\(U\\) can be then expressed as\n\\[\nU=\\sqrt{I_0}\\left (1+h+h^2+\\ldots +h^{M-1}\\right)\n\\]\nwhich is a geometric sum.

The black arrows represent the individual waves, the red arrow the sum of all waves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Multiple beam interference pattern for M=6 beams. The intensity distribution is shown as a function of the phase shift \\(\\phi\\). The first minimum is at \\(\\phi=2\\pi/M\\). The intensity distribution is symmetric around \\(\\phi=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is therefore an oscillating function. The numerator \\(\\sin^2(M\\Delta \\phi/2)\\) shows and oscillation frequency, which is by a factor of \\(M\\) higher than the one in the denominator \\(\\sin^2 (\\Delta \\phi/2)\\). Therefore the intensity pattern is oscillating rapidly and creating a first minimum at\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=\\frac{2\\pi}{M}\n\\]\nThis is an important result, since it shows that the number of sources \\(M\\) determines the position of the first minimum and the interference peak gets narrower with increasing \\(M\\). Since the phase difference \\(\\Delta \\phi\\) between neighboring sources is the same as for the double slit experiment, i.e. \\(\\Delta \\phi=2\\pi d/\\lambda \\sin(\\theta)\\), we can also determine the angular position of the first minimum. This is given by\n\\[\n\\sin(\\theta_\\textrm{min})=\\frac{1}{M}\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\n\\]\nThis again has the common feature that it scales as \\(\\lambda/d\\). A special situation occurs, whenever the numerator and the denominator become zero. This will happen whenever\n\\[\n\\Delta \\phi=m 2\\pi\n\\]\nwhere \\(m\\) is an integer and denotes the interference order, i.e. the number of wavelength that neighboring partial waves have as path length difference. In this case, the intensity distributiion will give us\n\\[\nI=I_0 \\frac{0}{0}\n\\]\nand we have to determine the limit with the help of l’Hospitals rule. The outcome of this calculation is, that\n\\[\nI(\\Delta \\phi=m2\\Delta \\pi)=M^2 I_0\n\\]\nwhich can be also realized when using the small angle approximation for the sine functions.\n\nWavevector Representation\nWe would like to introduce a different representation of the multiple wave interference of the grating, which is quite insightful. The first order (\\(m=1\\)) constructive interference condition is given by\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\sin{\\theta}= \\frac{1}{d}\n\\]\nwhich also means that\n\\[\n\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\sin{\\theta}= \\frac{2\\pi}{d}\n\\]\nThis can be written as\n\\[\nk \\sin{\\theta}= K\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the magnitude of the wavevector of the light and \\(K\\) is the wavevector magnitude that corresponds to the grating period \\(d\\). As the magnitude of the wavevector of the light is conserved, the wavevectors of the incident light and the light traveling along the direction of the first interence peak form the sides of an equilateral triangle. This is shown in the following figure.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n\nk = 1  # Magnitude of k₁ and k₂\n\norigin = np.array([0, 0])\n\nk1 = np.array([k, 0])\n\ntheta_deg = 30  # θ = 30 degrees\ntheta_rad = np.deg2rad(theta_deg)\n\nk2 = k * np.array([np.cos(theta_rad), np.sin(theta_rad)])\n\nK = k2 - k1\n\npoint_O = origin\npoint_A = point_O + k1\npoint_B = point_O + k2\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=get_size(10, 10))\nax = plt.gca()\n\n# Plot vector k₁\nax.arrow(point_O[0], point_O[1], k1[0], k1[1],\n         head_width=0.02, head_length=0.03, fc='k', ec='k', length_includes_head=True)\n\n\nax.arrow(point_A[0], point_A[1], K[0], K[1],\n         head_width=0.02, head_length=0.03, fc='b', ec='b', length_includes_head=True)\n\nax.arrow(point_O[0], point_O[1], k2[0], k2[1],\n         head_width=0.02, head_length=0.03, fc='k', ec='k', length_includes_head=True)\n\n# Label vectors\nax.text(k1[0]/2 - 0.05, k1[1]/2 - 0.05, r'$\\mathbf{k}$', fontsize=14, color='k')\nax.text(point_A[0] + K[0]/2 , point_A[1] + K[1]/2 + 0.05, r'$\\mathbf{K}$', fontsize=14, color='b')\nax.text(k2[0]/2 + 0.0, k2[1]/2+0.1, r'$\\mathbf{k}$', fontsize=14, color='k')\n\n# Indicate angle θ between k₁ and k₂ at the origin\narc_radius = 0.3  # Radius of the arc representing θ\nangle_range = np.linspace(0, theta_rad, 100)\narc_x = arc_radius * np.cos(angle_range)\narc_y = arc_radius * np.sin(angle_range)\nax.plot(arc_x, arc_y, color='k')\n\nax.text(arc_radius * np.cos(theta_rad / 2) + 0.02,\n        arc_radius * np.sin(theta_rad / 2) + 0.02,\n        r'$\\theta$', fontsize=14)\n\n# Set equal aspect ratio\nax.set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')\n\nall_x = [point_O[0], point_A[0], point_B[0]]\nall_y = [point_O[1], point_A[1], point_B[1]]\nmargin = 0.2\nax.set_xlim(min(all_x) - margin, max(all_x) + margin)\nax.set_ylim(min(all_y) - margin, max(all_y) + margin)\nplt.axis('off')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nWavevector summation for the diffraction grating. The wavevector of the incident light \\(k\\) and the wavevector of the light traveling along the direction of the first interference peak \\(K\\) form an equilateral triangle.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the diffraction grating is providing a wavevector \\(K\\) to alter the direction of the incident light. This is again a common feature reappearing in many situations as for example in the X-ray diffraction of crystals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Wave Interference with Decreasing Amplitude\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will turn our attention now to a slight modification of the previous multiwave interference. We will introduce a decreasing amplitude of the individual waves. The first wave shall have an amplitude \\(U_1=\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The next wave, however, will not only be phase shifted but also have a smaller amplitude.\n\\[\nU_2=h U_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(h=re^{i\\phi}\\) with \\(|h|=r&lt;1\\). \\(r\\) can be regarded as a reflection coefficient, which deminishes the amplitude of the incident wave. According to that the intensity is reduced by\n\\[\nI_2=|U_2|^2=|h U_1|^2=r^2 I_1\n\\]\nThe intensity of the incident wave is multiplied by a factor \\(r^2\\), while the amplitude is multiplied by \\(r\\). Note that the phase factor \\(e^{i\\Delta\\phi}\\) is removed when taking the square of this complex number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntensity at Boundaries\n\n\n\nThe amplitude of the reflected wave is diminished by a factor \\(r\\le 1\\), which is called the reflection coefficient. The intensity is diminished by a factor \\(R=|r|^2\\le1\\), which is the reflectance.\nIn the absence of absorption, reflectance \\(R\\) and transmittance \\(T\\) add to one due to energy conservation.\n\\[\nR+T=1\n\\]\n\n\nConsequently, the third wave would be now \\(U_3=hU_2=h^2U_1\\). The total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2+U_3+\\ldots+U_M = \\sqrt{I_0}(1+h+h^2+\\ldots)\n\\]\n\n\n\nCode\nM = 18  # number of phasors\nphi = np.pi/6  # example phase difference between successive phasors\nr = 0.95  # reduction factor for each subsequent phasor\n\ndef plot_angle(ax, pos, angle, length=0.95, acol=\"C0\", **kwargs):\n    vec2 = np.array([np.cos(np.deg2rad(angle)), np.sin(np.deg2rad(angle))])\n    xy = np.c_[[length, 0], [0, 0], vec2*length].T + np.array(pos)\n    ax.plot(*xy.T, color=acol)\n    return AngleAnnotation(pos, xy[0], xy[2], ax=ax, **kwargs)\n\ndef calculate_phasors(phi, M, r):\n    x_start = np.zeros(M)\n    y_start = np.zeros(M)\n    x_end = np.zeros(M)\n    y_end = np.zeros(M)\n\n    x_sum = 0\n    y_sum = 0\n\n    for i in range(M):\n        amplitude = r**i  # exponential decrease\n        x = amplitude * np.cos(i * phi)\n        y = amplitude * np.sin(i * phi)\n\n        x_start[i] = x_sum\n        y_start[i] = y_sum\n\n        x_sum += x\n        y_sum += y\n\n        x_end[i] = x_sum\n        y_end[i] = y_sum\n\n    return x_start, y_start, x_end, y_end\n\nx_start, y_start, x_end, y_end = calculate_phasors(phi, M, r)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=get_size(6, 6),dpi=150)\nax = plt.gca()\n\nfor i in range(M):\n    plt.arrow(x_start[i], y_start[i],\n             x_end[i]-x_start[i], y_end[i]-y_start[i],\n             head_width=0.15, head_length=0.2,\n             fc='k', ec='k',\n             length_includes_head=True,\n             label=f'E{i+1}' if i == 0 else \"\")\n\nplt.arrow(0, 0, x_end[-1], y_end[-1],\n         head_width=0.15, head_length=0.2, fc='r', ec='r',\n         length_includes_head=True, label='Resultant')\n\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nxx = np.linspace(-1, 3, 100)\nax.plot(xx,(xx-1)*np.tan(phi),'k--',lw=0.5)\nax.plot([1,3],[0,0],'k--',lw=0.5)\nkw = dict(size=195, unit=\"points\", text=r\"$\\phi$\")\nplot_angle(ax, (1.0, 0), phi*180/np.pi, textposition=\"inside\", **kw)\nplt.axis('off')\nmax_range = max(abs(x_end[-1]), abs(y_end[-1])) * 1.2\nplt.xlim(-max_range/1.8, max_range/0.8)\nplt.ylim(-0.1, max_range/0.9)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase construction of a multiwave intereference with M waves with decreasing amplitude due to a reflection coefficient \\(r=0.95\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Create phase array from -2π to 2π\nphi = np.linspace(-2*np.pi, 2*np.pi, 1000)\n\ndef calculate_intensity(phi, F):\n    return 1/(1 + 4*(F/np.pi)**2 * np.sin(phi/2)**2)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=get_size(10, 6))\n\nfinesse_values = [1, 4, 20]\nstyles = ['-', '--', ':']\n\nfor F, style in zip(finesse_values, styles):\n    I = calculate_intensity(phi, F)\n    plt.plot(phi/np.pi, I, style, label=f'$\\\\mathcal{{F}}={F}$')\n\nplt.xlabel('Phase $\\\\phi/\\\\pi$')\nplt.ylabel('$I/I_{\\\\mathrm{max}}$')\nplt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nplt.legend()\nplt.ylim(0, 1.1)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple wave interference with decreasing amplitude.

With those abbrevations, we obtain\n\\[\nI=\\frac{I_{\\rm max}}{1+4\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{F}}{\\pi}\\right)^2\\sin^{2}(\\Delta\\phi/2)}\n\\]\nfor the interference of multiple waves with decreasing amplitude.\nThis intensity distribution has a different shape than the one we obtained for multiple waves with the same amplitude.\nWe clearly observe that with increasing Finesse the intensity maxima, which occur at multiples fo \\(\\pi\\) get much narrower. In addition the regions between the maxima show better contrast and fopr higher Finesse we get complete destructive interference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLight beating\n\nBeating of two waves\nLet us consider now interference in the time domain. We introduce two monochromatic waves of frequencies \\(\\nu_1\\) and \\(\\nu_2\\). We will denote their amplitudes by \\(\\sqrt{I_1}\\) and \\(\\sqrt{I_2}\\).\nThe total amplitude is thus\n\\[\nU=U_1+U_2 = \\sqrt{I_1} \\exp(i2\\pi\\nu_1 t) + \\sqrt{I_2} \\exp(i2\\pi\\nu_2 t)\n\\]\nsuch that we obtain an Intensity\n\\[\nI=|U|^2 = I_1 + I_2 + 2\\sqrt{I_1I_2}\\cos(2\\pi(\\nu_1-\\nu_2)t)\n\\]\nThe intensity is thus time dependent and oscillates at a frequency \\(\\nu_1-\\nu_2\\), which is the so-called beating frequency. Similar schemes are used in optical heterodyne detection but also in acoustics when tuning your guitar.\n\n\nMultiple wave beating and pulse generation\nConsider now a whole set of \\(M=2L+1\\) each with an amplitude \\(\\sqrt{I_0}\\). The frequencies of the waves are given by \\(\\nu_q=\\nu_0+q\\Delta\\nu\\) with \\(q=-L,\\dots,L\\) with \\(\\nu_0\\) beeing the center frequency of the spectrum and \\(\\Delta \\nu\\) the frequency spacing. We will assume that \\(\\Delta nu&lt;&lt;\\nu_0\\) such that the total amplitude of the waves is given by\n\\[\nU=\\sum_{q=-L}^L \\sqrt{I_0} \\exp(i2\\pi(\\nu_0+q\\Delta\\nu)t)\n\\]\nThe total intensity can then be calculated in the same way as for the multiple source in space before. Using \\(\\phi=2\\pi \\Delta \\nu t\\) we obtained \\[\nI(t)=I_0 \\frac{\\sin^2(M\\pi t/T)}{\\sin^2(\\pi t/T)}\n\\]\nwith \\(T=1/\\Delta\\nu\\) and a maximum intensity of \\(I_{\\rm max}=M^2 I_0\\).\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Parameters\nDelta_nu = 1e9  # 1 GHz\nM = 1000\nI0 = 1  # Normalized initial intensity\nT = 1/Delta_nu  # 1 ns\npulse_width = T/M  # 1 ps\n\n# Create figure with two subplots\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(15, 10),\n                             gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [2, 1]})\n\n# Time array for main plot showing multiple pulses\nt_main = np.linspace(-2*T, 2*T, 20000)\n\n# Time array for inset showing single pulse detail\nt_detail = np.linspace(-5*pulse_width, 5*pulse_width, 10000)\n\n# Calculate intensity function (avoiding division by zero)\ndef intensity(t, M, T, I0):\n    # Small value to prevent division by zero\n    eps = 1e-10\n    # Calculate using the formula\n    num = np.sin(M * np.pi * t / T)**2\n    den = np.sin(np.pi * t / T)**2\n    # Handle points where denominator is near zero\n    near_zero = np.abs(np.sin(np.pi * t / T)) &lt; eps\n\n    result = np.zeros_like(t, dtype=float)\n    # For normal points, use formula\n    mask = ~near_zero\n    result[mask] = I0 * num[mask] / den[mask]\n    # For points where denominator is near zero, use limit value\n    result[near_zero] = M**2 * I0\n\n    return result\n\n# Calculate intensities\nI_main = intensity(t_main, M, T, I0)\nI_detail = intensity(t_detail, M, T, I0)\n\n# Maximum intensity\nmax_intensity = M**2 * I0\n\n# Main plot showing multiple pulses\nax1.plot(t_main*1e9, I_main, 'b-')\nax1.set_xlabel('time [ns]')\nax1.set_ylabel(r' $I/I_{0}$')\nax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\n# Mark maximum intensity\nax1.axhline(y=max_intensity, color='r', linestyle='--')\n\n# Mark period T\nax1.annotate('', xy=(T*1e9, 0.5e6), xytext=(0, 0.5e6),\n           arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='&lt;-&gt;', color='g'))\nax1.text(0.5*T*1e9, max_intensity*1.1, f'T = 1/Δν = {T*1e9:.1f} ns',\n        color='g', ha='center')\n\n\nax1.set_ylim(0, max_intensity*1.2)\n\n# Detail plot showing single pulse\nax2.plot(t_detail*1e12, I_detail, 'b-')\nax2.set_xlabel('time [ps]')\nax2.set_ylabel(r'$I/I_{0}$')\n\n\n# Mark pulse width\nax2.annotate('', xy=(-pulse_width/1*1e12, max_intensity*1.05),\n           xytext=(pulse_width/1*1e12, max_intensity*1.05),\n           arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='&lt;-&gt;', color='m'))\nax2.text(0, max_intensity*1.1, f'T/M = {pulse_width*1e12:.1f} ps',\n        color='m', ha='center')\n\nax2.set_ylim(0, max_intensity*1.2)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Multiple wave beating with M=1000 monochromatic waves separated by Δν=1 GHz.

A frequency comb is a spectrum consisting of a series of discrete, equally spaced frequency lines that results from a train of phase-coherent pulses in the time domain.\n\nFrom Pulse Trains to Frequency Combs\nLet’s extend our understanding of multiple wave beating to include phase coherence. When we have a set of equidistant frequency components that maintain a fixed phase relationship, the resulting time-domain signal is a periodic train of pulses. Conversely, a periodic train of pulses in the time domain corresponds to a frequency comb in the spectral domain.\nThe relationship between these domains is described by the Fourier transform. For a pulse train with repetition rate \\(f_{rep} = \\Delta\\nu\\) (the spacing between frequency components), the frequency spectrum consists of lines at:\n\\[f_n = f_0 + n \\cdot f_{rep}\\]\nwhere \\(f_0\\) is the carrier-envelope offset frequency and \\(n\\) is an integer.\n\n\nMathematical Description\nConsider a train of pulses described by the electric field:\n\\[E(t) = \\sum_{m=-\\infty}^{\\infty} A(t - m T_{rep}) e^{i[\\omega_c(t - m T_{rep}) + \\phi_{CE} \\cdot m + \\phi_0]}\\]\nwhere: - \\(A(t)\\) is the pulse envelope - \\(T_{rep} = 1/f_{rep}\\) is the pulse repetition period - \\(\\omega_c\\) is the carrier frequency - \\(\\phi_{CE}\\) is the carrier-envelope phase slip (the phase shift from pulse to pulse) - \\(\\phi_0\\) is a constant phase\nThe Fourier transform of this pulse train gives us a frequency comb with:\n\\[f_0 = \\frac{\\phi_{CE}}{2\\pi} \\cdot f_{rep}\\]\nThis carrier-envelope offset frequency (\\(f_0\\)) is crucial for determining the absolute positions of the comb lines.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy.fft import fft, fftfreq, fftshift\n\n# Parameters\nf_rep = 0.1e12  # 100 GHz repetition rate\nf_0 = 0.2 * f_rep  # Carrier-envelope offset frequency (20% of f_rep)\nf_c = 2e12  # 2 THz carrier frequency (simplified for visualization)\npulse_fwhm = 50e-15  # 50 fs pulse width\n\n# Time domain\nN = 2**14  # Number of points for good FFT resolution\nT_total = 100e-12  # 100 ps total window (multiple pulses)\ndt = T_total / N\nt = np.linspace(0, T_total, N, endpoint=False)\n\n# Pulse envelope function (Gaussian)\ndef gaussian_envelope(t, t0, fwhm):\n    # Convert FWHM to standard deviation\n    sigma = fwhm / (2 * np.sqrt(2 * np.log(2)))\n    return np.exp(-((t - t0) ** 2) / (2 * sigma ** 2))\n\n# Generate a train of pulses with carrier-envelope phase evolution\ndef pulse_train(t, f_rep, f_c, f_0, fwhm):\n    T_rep = 1/f_rep\n    omega_c = 2 * np.pi * f_c\n    phi_CE = 2 * np.pi * f_0 / f_rep  # Phase slip per pulse\n\n    # Initialize field\n    E = np.zeros_like(t, dtype=complex)\n\n    # Add multiple pulses\n    for m in range(int(T_total * f_rep) + 5):  # +5 to ensure we capture all pulses\n        t0 = m * T_rep\n        if t0 &gt; T_total:\n            break\n\n        # Pulse envelope\n        env = gaussian_envelope(t, t0, fwhm)\n\n        # Carrier with phase evolution\n        carrier = np.exp(1j * (omega_c * (t - t0) + phi_CE * m))\n\n        # Add pulse to field\n        E += env * carrier\n\n    return E\n\n# Generate the electric field\nE_t = pulse_train(t, f_rep, f_c, f_0, pulse_fwhm)\n\n# Calculate intensity in time domain\nI_t = np.abs(E_t)**2\n\n# Calculate the frequency spectrum\nE_f = fftshift(fft(E_t))\nf = fftshift(fftfreq(N, dt))  # Frequency axis\nI_f = np.abs(E_f)**2\n\n# Normalize for better visualization\nI_t_norm = I_t / np.max(I_t)\nI_f_norm = I_f / np.max(I_f)\n\n# Create figure with two subplots\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Time domain plot\nax1.plot(t*1e12, I_t_norm, 'b-')\nax1.set_xlabel('Time [ps]')\nax1.set_ylabel('Normalized Intensity')\nax1.set_title('Pulse Train (Time Domain)')\nax1.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nax1.set_xlim(0, 50)  # Show a subset of the time window\n\n# Annotate T_rep\nt_rep = 1/f_rep\nax1.annotate('', xy=(t_rep*1e12, 0.1), xytext=(0, 0.1),\n             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='&lt;-&gt;', color='red'))\nax1.text(t_rep*1e12/2, 0.15, f'$T_{{rep}}$ = {t_rep*1e12:.1f} ps',\n         ha='center', color='red')\n\n# Frequency domain plot - zoomed around carrier frequency\nf_min = f_c - 5*f_rep\nf_max = f_c + 5*f_rep\nf_mask = (f &gt; f_min) & (f &lt; f_max)\n\nax2.plot(f[f_mask]*1e-12, I_f_norm[f_mask], 'g-')\nax2.set_xlabel('Frequency [THz]')\nax2.set_ylabel('Normalized Spectral Power')\nax2.set_title('Frequency Comb')\nax2.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\n# Annotate frequency spacing\nmax_peaks = np.where(I_f_norm[f_mask] &gt; 0.5)[0]\nif len(max_peaks) &gt;= 2:\n    peak_indices = np.sort(max_peaks)[:2]\n    peak_freqs = f[f_mask][peak_indices]\n    ax2.annotate('', xy=(peak_freqs[1]*1e-12, 0.5), xytext=(peak_freqs[0]*1e-12, 0.5),\n                 arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='&lt;-&gt;', color='red'))\n    ax2.text((peak_freqs[0] + peak_freqs[1])*1e-12/2, 0.6,\n             f'$f_{{rep}}$ = {f_rep*1e-9:.0f} GHz', ha='center', color='red')\n\n# Mark f_0\nax2.annotate('$f_0$', xy=(f_0*1e-12, 0.3), xytext=(f_0*1e-12, 0.4),\n             arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='-&gt;', color='purple'))\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Demonstration of a frequency comb. (Left) Time domain representation showing a train of phase-coherent pulses. (Right) Frequency domain representation showing equally spaced frequency lines forming a comb structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplications of Frequency Combs\nFrequency combs have revolutionized precision measurements in physics and enabled numerous applications:\n\nOptical Clocks: Frequency combs provide a “gear mechanism” to count optical frequencies, enabling optical atomic clocks that are orders of magnitude more precise than conventional atomic clocks.\nPrecision Spectroscopy: The precise and stable frequency references allow for high-resolution molecular spectroscopy.\nCalibration of Astronomical Spectrographs: Frequency combs enable the detection of Earth-like exoplanets by providing precise wavelength calibration for astronomical instruments.\nDistance Measurements: They enable precise absolute distance measurements used in applications from gravitational wave detectors to satellite formation flying.\nTelecommunications: Frequency combs can be used for wavelength-division multiplexing in optical communications.\n\n\n\nConnection to Mode-Locked Lasers\nIn practice, frequency combs are often generated using mode-locked lasers. In such lasers, multiple longitudinal modes of the laser cavity oscillate with a fixed phase relationship, resulting in short pulses. The Fourier transform of these regularly spaced pulses is precisely the frequency comb.\nThe mode-locking can be achieved through various mechanisms:\n\nActive mode-locking: Using an external modulator driven at the cavity round-trip frequency\nPassive mode-locking: Using saturable absorbers or Kerr-lens mode-locking\n\nThe 2005 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Theodor W. Hänsch and John L. Hall for their contributions to the development of laser-based precision spectroscopy, including the optical frequency comb technique.\n\n\nThe Fundamental Link Between Time and Frequency Domains\nFrequency combs beautifully illustrate the duality between time and frequency domains in physics. A perfectly periodic sequence of events in time (the pulse train) corresponds to discrete, equally spaced frequencies. The more precise and stable the temporal pattern, the more precise and stable the frequency components.\nThis duality is fundamental to many areas of physics and engineering, from quantum mechanics to signal processing, and frequency combs represent one of its most elegant and useful manifestations in optics.",

    "text": "Destructive Interference of Non-Minimal Paths\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can demonstrate that all paths except the shortest one interfere destructively using Feynman’s path integral formulation. In this approach, light takes all possible paths between points A and B, with each path contributing an amplitude with phase \\(e^{iS/\\hbar}\\), where \\(S\\) is the action proportional to the optical path length: \\(S = kL\\) where \\(k = 2\\pi/\\lambda\\) is the wave number.\nTo understand why non-minimal paths cancel out, let’s denote the minimal path as \\(x_0(t)\\) and nearby paths as \\(x_0(t) + \\delta x(t)\\), where \\(\\delta x(t)\\) represents small deviations. The action for these perturbed paths expands as: \\[S[x_0 + \\delta x] = S[x_0] + \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\delta x + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x)^2 + ...\\]\nSince \\(x_0\\) is the extremal path (according to Fermat’s principle), we have \\(\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}\\bigg|_{x_0} = 0\\). This means the first-order term vanishes, leaving the quadratic term as the leading contribution to the phase difference:\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = S[x] - S[x_0] \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x)^2\\]\nThis quadratic dependence is crucial: as we move away from the minimal path, the phase difference increases as the square of the deviation \\(\\delta x\\). When we consider a specific deviation \\(\\delta x_c\\) where \\(\\Delta\\phi = \\pi\\), paths will contribute with exactly opposite phases compared to the minimal path, leading to destructive interference:\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x_c)^2 = \\pi\\]\nFor even larger deviations, the phase differences continue to increase, creating alternating bands of constructive and destructive interference. When summed over all possible paths, these rapidly varying phases cancel each other out.\nFor paths far from the minimal one, the destructive interference is even more pronounced. Mathematically, we can demonstrate this by considering a continuous distribution of paths with optical path lengths \\(L\\). The total amplitude contribution from these paths is given by:\n\\[A = \\int e^{ikL(x)} dx\\]\nFor non-minimal paths, we can parametrize the path length as \\(L(x) = L_0 + \\alpha(x-x_0)^2\\) for some constant \\(\\alpha\\), where \\(x_0\\) corresponds to the minimal path. The amplitude becomes:\n\\[A = \\int e^{ik(L_0 + \\alpha(x-x_0)^2)} dx = e^{ikL_0}\\int e^{ik\\alpha(x-x_0)^2} dx\\]\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\\[A = e^{ikL_0}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{k\\alpha}}e^{i\\pi/4}\\]\nThe key insight is that the amplitude scales as \\(1/\\sqrt{k\\alpha}\\), which means that as the curvature \\(\\alpha\\) of the path length function increases (as happens far from the minimal path), the contribution to the total amplitude diminishes. This mathematically proves why non-minimal path regions contribute negligibly to the overall path integral.\nThis cancellation mechanism explains why light appears to follow only the path of least time in ray optics. The mathematics shows that constructive interference occurs only for paths very close to the minimal path, while all other paths destructively interfere with their neighbors. This phenomenon emerges naturally from wave properties without requiring quantum mechanical constants like ℏ. We can express this classically by setting \\(S = kL\\) and observing how path differences relative to the wavelength create interference patterns.\n\n\nCode\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\n# Parameters\nnum_paths = 100\nmin_path_index = num_paths // 2\npath_deviation = np.linspace(-2, 2, num_paths)  # Deviation from minimal path\nalpha = 5  # Curvature parameter controlling phase variation rate\n\n# Calculate phase for each path (quadratic dependence on deviation)\nphases = alpha * path_deviation**2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(14, 8))\n\n# Plot phase vs path deviation with a simple blue line and points\nax.plot(path_deviation, phases, '-', color='blue', linewidth=2)\n\n# Highlight the minimal path\nax.axvline(x=0, color='r', linestyle='--', linewidth=2, label='Minimal path')\n\n# Highlight paths near minimal path\nnear_minimal = np.abs(path_deviation) &lt; 0.3\n#ax.scatter(path_deviation[near_minimal], phases[near_minimal],\n#          color='green', s=70, label='Near minimal path', zorder=3)\n\n# Set labels and grid\nax.set_xlabel('path deviation')\nax.set_ylabel('phase [rad]')\n\n\n# Add horizontal lines at multiples of π to show constructive/destructive interference\nfor i in range(int(np.max(phases)/np.pi) + 1):\n    if i == 0:\n        ax.axhline(y=i*np.pi, color='k', linestyle='-', alpha=0.2,\n                  label='Constructive interference')\n    elif i % 2 == 0:\n        ax.axhline(y=i*np.pi, color='k', linestyle='-', alpha=0.2)\n    else:\n        ax.axhline(y=i*np.pi, color='k', linestyle='--', alpha=0.2,\n                  label='Destructive interference' if i==1 else None)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Visualization of path phases in Fermat’s principle. The figure shows how the phase varies with path deviation from the minimal path (marked by the vertical red line at zero). The quadratic relationship between phase and path deviation demonstrates why paths near the minimal one constructively interfere (similar phases), while non-minimal paths tend to cancel through destructive interference (rapidly varying phases)."

It contains many facets of research involving light propgation from fundamentals involving light matter interaction to applications involving photonic computing with disordered media or single light quanta to adaptive superresolution microscopy. It is one of the fastest growing fields.\nIn this course we will introduce into the field of optics and photonics. We will start with simple but powerful descriptions of light propagation using ray optics to more advanced physics using electromagnetic waves. We will explore Fourier optics, anisotropic media and non-linear optics to lay the foundation to more complex topics in advanced lecture series.",

    "text": "In classical optics, light is treated as an electromagnetic wave. However, at the quantum level, light consists of discrete energy packets called photons. The statistical distribution of these photons provides profound insights into the nature of light sources.\n\n\n\n\nTo understand photon statistics, we first need to conceptualize light as a stream of discrete photons arriving at a detector over time. Let’s develop a model where we divide our total observation time \\(T\\) into \\(M\\) equal time bins, each of duration \\(\\Delta t = T/M\\).\nFor a light source with average intensity \\(I\\), the average number of photons expected in the entire observation period is \\(\\bar{n} = \\alpha T\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is proportional to the intensity. The average number of photons per time bin is therefore \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M = \\alpha \\Delta t\\).\nIn a random photon stream, the arrival of each photon is an independent event with no memory of previous arrivals. This means that for small enough time bins, each bin has: - A probability \\(p = \\mu\\) of containing exactly one photon - A probability \\(1-p\\) of containing no photons - A negligible probability of containing more than one photon (for sufficiently small \\(\\Delta t\\))\n\n\n\nGiven these properties, we can calculate the probability \\(P(n,M)\\) of detecting exactly \\(n\\) photons in \\(M\\) time bins. This is equivalent to asking: what is the probability of having exactly \\(n\\) successes in \\(M\\) independent trials, where the probability of success in each trial is \\(p = \\mu\\)?\nThis is precisely the binomial distribution:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} p^n (1-p)^{M-n} = \\binom{M}{n} \\mu^n (1-\\mu)^{M-n}\\]\nwhere \\(\\binom{M}{n} = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!}\\) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose \\(n\\) time bins from \\(M\\) total bins.\n\n\n\nNow, let’s consider what happens as we make our time bins smaller and more numerous. In the limit where \\(M \\to \\infty\\) and \\(\\Delta t \\to 0\\), while keeping the total observation time \\(T\\) and the average photon number \\(\\bar{n}\\) constant:\n\nThe number of bins \\(M\\) increases\nThe probability per bin \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M\\) decreases\nThe product \\(M\\mu = \\bar{n}\\) remains constant\n\nIn this limit, the binomial distribution approaches the Poisson distribution. To see this, we substitute \\(\\mu = \\bar{n}/M\\) into the binomial formula:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\binom{M}{n} \\left(\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^n \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}\\]\nRearranging:\n\\[P(n,M) = \\frac{M!}{n!(M-n)!} \\cdot \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{M^n} \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n}\\]\nAs \\(M \\to \\infty\\), we can use the following approximations:\n\\[\\frac{M!}{(M-n)!M^n} \\approx 1\\]\nfor large \\(M\\) and fixed \\(n\\), and:\n\\[\\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^{M-n} \\approx \\left(1-\\frac{\\bar{n}}{M}\\right)^M \\approx e^{-\\bar{n}}\\]\napplying the limit definition of the exponential function.\nThis gives us the Poisson distribution:\n\\[P(n) = \\lim_{M \\to \\infty} P(n,M) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n e^{-\\bar{n}}}{n!}\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{n}\\) is the mean photon number in the interval.\n\n\n\nThe Poisson distribution has the remarkable property that its variance equals its mean:\n\\[\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle = \\bar{n}\\]\nThis equal mean and variance is a signature of the randomness in the photon arrival process, where events occur independently and at a constant average rate.\nTo verify this property, we can calculate the mean and variance directly from the probability distribution:\nThe mean: \\(\\langle n \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P(n) = \\bar{n}\\)\nThe variance: \\(\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} (n-\\bar{n})^2 P(n) = \\bar{n}\\)\n\n\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a crucial metric in experimental physics, quantifying our ability to distinguish a signal from the background noise. For a measurement, the SNR is defined as the ratio of the mean signal to the standard deviation of the noise:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\text{signal}}{\\text{noise}} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}\\]\nFor random light following Poisson statistics, we have:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}} = \\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\]\nThis relationship reveals an important property of random light: the SNR scales as the square root of the mean photon number. This is known as the “shot noise limit” and represents a fundamental quantum limit to measurement precision with coherent light. To improve the SNR by a factor of 2, we need to increase the light intensity (or integration time) by a factor of 4.\nThis \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\) scaling of SNR is a direct consequence of the statistical independence of photon arrivals in coherent light and plays a crucial role in determining the sensitivity limits of optical measurements, from astronomical observations to laser-based communications.\nThis statistical behavior is characteristic of coherent light sources such as ideal lasers, where photon emission events are independent of each other.\n\n\n\n\nA beam splitter is an optical component that splits an incident beam into two parts. For a 50:50 beam splitter, an incoming photon has equal probability of being transmitted or reflected. Interestingly, when random (Poissonian) light is incident on a beam splitter, the statistics of the output beams remain Poissonian.\nTo understand why, consider that each photon in the input beam makes an independent decision to be transmitted or reflected. If the input beam has Poisson statistics with mean \\(\\bar{n}\\), the transmitted beam will have a mean of \\(\\bar{n}_T = R\\bar{n}\\) and the reflected beam will have a mean of \\(\\bar{n}_R = T\\bar{n}\\), where \\(R\\) and \\(T\\) are the reflection and transmission coefficients (\\(R + T = 1\\)).\nThe independence of photon behavior ensures that both output beams maintain Poisson statistics, just with scaled means. This is mathematically represented as:\n\\[P_T(n_T) = \\frac{(R\\bar{n})^{n_T} e^{-R\\bar{n}}}{n_T!}\\]\n\\[P_R(n_R) = \\frac{(T\\bar{n})^{n_R} e^{-T\\bar{n}}}{n_R!}\\]\nThis preservation of statistics is a direct consequence of the binomial sampling of the original Poisson distribution, which yields another Poisson distribution.\n\n\n\nThermal light, such as that emitted by incandescent bulbs or stars, exhibits different statistical properties. The emission process in thermal sources involves atoms transitioning between energy levels due to thermal excitation. This process leads to what we call “bunching” of photons.\nFor thermal light, the probability distribution of photons follows:\n\\[P(n) = \\frac{\\bar{n}^n}{(1+\\bar{n})^{n+1}}\\]\nThis distribution results in a variance that exceeds the mean:\n\\[\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\langle n \\rangle + \\langle n \\rangle^2 = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2\\]\nThe photon number fluctuations are larger than in coherent light, reflecting the bunching tendency of thermal photons. This bunching arises from the Bose-Einstein statistics governing photons, which encourages multiple photons to occupy the same mode.\nThe intensity fluctuations of thermal light follow an exponential distribution:\n\\[P(I) = \\frac{1}{\\langle I \\rangle} e^{-I/\\langle I \\rangle}\\]\nThis exponential behavior is a direct consequence of the random nature of thermal emission processes, where the radiation field is built up from the contributions of many independent atomic emitters.\n\n\nThe signal-to-noise ratio for thermal light differs significantly from that of coherent light due to the different statistical distribution of photons. Using the definition of SNR as the ratio of mean signal to the standard deviation of noise:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\langle n \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle}}\\]\nFor thermal light, with \\(\\langle (\\Delta n)^2 \\rangle = \\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2\\), we have:\n\\[\\text{SNR} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\sqrt{\\bar{n} + \\bar{n}^2}} = \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\bar{n}} + 1}}\\]\nIn the limit of large photon numbers (\\(\\bar{n} \\gg 1\\)), which is common for thermal light sources, this simplifies to:\n\\[\\text{SNR} \\approx \\frac{\\bar{n}}{\\bar{n}} = 1\\]\nThis is a striking result: for thermal light at high intensities, the SNR approaches a constant value of 1, regardless of how much we increase the intensity. This is in stark contrast to the coherent light case where SNR increases as \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\).\nThis fundamental limitation on the SNR of thermal light is due to the inherent “excess noise” from photon bunching. It explains why many precision optical measurements preferentially use laser sources (with Poisson statistics) rather than thermal sources, even when high intensities are available.\nThe comparison between thermal light (SNR ~ 1) and coherent light (SNR ~ \\(\\sqrt{\\bar{n}}\\)) provides a clear example of how the quantum statistical properties of a light source directly impact measurement sensitivity in practical applications.",

From Classical Fields to Quantum Optics\n\n2.1 Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field\nTo transition from classical optics to quantum optics, we need to quantize the electromagnetic field. We start with Maxwell’s equations in vacuum and consider a single mode of the field in a cavity of volume \\(V\\).\nThe classical electric and magnetic fields for a mode with wavevector \\(\\vec{k}\\) and polarization \\(\\vec{\\epsilon}\\) can be written as:\n\\[\\vec{E}(\\vec{r},t) = E_0(a(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)\\vec{\\epsilon}^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\] \\[\\vec{B}(\\vec{r},t) = B_0(a(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})e^{i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}} + a^*(t)(\\vec{k}\\times\\vec{\\epsilon})^*e^{-i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}})\\]\nwhere \\(E_0\\) and \\(B_0\\) are constants, and \\(a(t)\\) and \\(a^*(t)\\) are complex amplitudes.\nThe energy of this field is:\n\\[H = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_V (\\epsilon_0 E^2 + \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}B^2)d^3r = \\hbar\\omega(a^*a + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nObserve that this has the same form as the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator. This suggests replacing the complex amplitudes \\(a\\) and \\(a^*\\) with operators \\(\\hat{a}\\) and \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) that satisfy the commutation relation:\n\\[[\\hat{a}, \\hat{a}^\\dagger] = 1\\]\nThe Hamiltonian then becomes:\n\\[\\hat{H} = \\hbar\\omega(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a} + \\frac{1}{2})\\]\nThis is precisely the Hamiltonian of a quantum harmonic oscillator, where \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\hat{a}\\) is the number operator \\(\\hat{n}\\) that counts the number of photons in the mode.\n\n\n2.2 Photon States and Quadrature Components\nThe energy eigenstates of this quantum harmonic oscillator are the Fock states \\(|n\\rangle\\), which represent states with exactly \\(n\\) photons. The action of the creation and annihilation operators on these states is:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1}|n+1\\rangle\\] \\[\\hat{a}|n\\rangle = \\sqrt{n}|n-1\\rangle\\]\nJust as in a mechanical harmonic oscillator with position \\(x\\) and momentum \\(p\\), we can define quadrature components for the quantized electromagnetic field:\n\\[\\hat{X} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{P} = \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{a})\\]\nThese operators are analogous to the position and momentum operators of a mechanical oscillator and satisfy the commutation relation:\n\\[[\\hat{X}, \\hat{P}] = i\\]\nThe physical interpretation of these quadratures becomes clear when we look at the expectation value of the electric field operator in a coherent state \\(|\\alpha\\rangle\\) (which is the quantum state that most closely resembles a classical electromagnetic wave):\n\\[\\langle\\alpha|\\hat{E}(\\vec{r},t)|\\alpha\\rangle \\propto \\langle\\alpha|(\\hat{a}e^{-i\\omega t} + \\hat{a}^\\dagger e^{i\\omega t})|\\alpha\\rangle = 2|\\alpha|\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi)\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha = |\\alpha|e^{i\\phi}\\).\nWe can see that \\(\\hat{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{P}\\) correspond to the amplitude and phase quadratures of the field, respectively. They are the quantum analogs of the in-phase and out-of-phase components of a classical electromagnetic wave.\nThe uncertainty principle for these quadratures,\n\\[\\Delta X \\cdot \\Delta P \\geq \\frac{1}{2}\\]\nimplies fundamental limits on our ability to simultaneously determine both quadratures with arbitrary precision. This leads to interesting quantum states of light such as squeezed states, where the uncertainty in one quadrature is reduced below the standard quantum limit at the expense of increased uncertainty in the conjugate quadrature.",

Photon Entanglement on a Beam Splitter\n\n3.1 Quantum Operator Approach to Entanglement\nOne of the most fascinating phenomena in quantum optics is the creation of entangled photon states. A beam splitter, beyond its classical role, can actually generate quantum entanglement under specific conditions.\nConsider a situation where two identical photons simultaneously enter a 50:50 beam splitter from different input ports. Quantum mechanically, we denote the creation operators for the input ports as \\(\\hat{a}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{b}^\\dagger\\), and for the output ports as \\(\\hat{c}^\\dagger\\) and \\(\\hat{d}^\\dagger\\).\nThe beam splitter transformation can be written as:\n\\[\\hat{c}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger + \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\] \\[\\hat{d}^\\dagger = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\hat{a}^\\dagger - \\hat{b}^\\dagger)\\]\nThe initial state with one photon in each input port is \\(|1_a, 1_b\\rangle = \\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle\\). After passing through the beam splitter, this state becomes:\n\\[\\hat{a}^\\dagger \\hat{b}^\\dagger |0\\rangle \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{c}^\\dagger + \\hat{d}^\\dagger)(\\hat{c}^\\dagger - \\hat{d}^\\dagger)|0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}((\\hat{c}^\\dagger)^2 - (\\hat{d}^\\dagger)^2)|0\\rangle\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_c, 0_d\\rangle - |0_c, 2_d\\rangle)\\]\nThis is an entangled state where either both photons exit through port \\(c\\) or both exit through port \\(d\\), with no possibility of one photon in each output port. This phenomenon, known as the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is a direct manifestation of quantum interference and photon indistinguishability.\nThe entanglement is evident because the state cannot be factorized into a product of states for the two output modes. This non-classical correlation is a resource for quantum information processing and quantum communication protocols.\n\n\n3.2 Probability Amplitude Approach to Entanglement\nWe can also understand photon entanglement through the language of probability amplitudes and phase factors, which may be more intuitive for visualizing what happens at a beam splitter.\nWhen a single photon encounters a beam splitter, there are two possible outcomes: reflection or transmission. In quantum mechanics, we associate probability amplitudes with each outcome:\n\nFor reflection: amplitude \\(r = \\sqrt{R}e^{i\\phi_r}\\), where \\(R\\) is the reflection probability and \\(\\phi_r\\) is a phase factor\nFor transmission: amplitude \\(t = \\sqrt{T}e^{i\\phi_t}\\), where \\(T\\) is the transmission probability and \\(\\phi_t\\) is a phase factor\n\nFor a 50:50 beam splitter, \\(R = T = 1/2\\). Importantly, the phase relationship between reflection and transmission must satisfy \\(\\phi_r - \\phi_t = \\pi/2\\) for energy conservation, which is typically implemented as \\(r = 1/\\sqrt{2}\\) and \\(t = i/\\sqrt{2}\\), where the imaginary unit \\(i\\) represents a 90u00b0 phase shift.\nNow, consider two photons entering the beam splitter from different input ports (let’s call them 1 and 2). There are four possible outcomes:\n\nBoth photons are reflected: Amplitude = \\(r_1 r_2 = 1/2\\)\nBoth photons are transmitted: Amplitude = \\(t_1 t_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})^2 = i^2/2 = -1/2\\)\nPhoton 1 reflected, Photon 2 transmitted: Amplitude = \\(r_1 t_2 = (1/\\sqrt{2})(i/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\nPhoton 1 transmitted, Photon 2 reflected: Amplitude = \\(t_1 r_2 = (i/\\sqrt{2})(1/\\sqrt{2}) = i/2\\)\n\nThe key insight comes when we consider the output ports (let’s call them 3 and 4). For both photons to exit through port 3, either both must be reflected or both must be transmitted. The combined amplitude is:\n\\[A_{both~in~3} = r_1 r_2 + t_1 t_2 = 1/2 + (-1/2) = 0\\]\nSimilarly, for both photons to exit through port 4:\n\\[A_{both~in~4} = t_1 r_2 + r_1 t_2 = i/2 + i/2 = i\\]\nFor one photon in each output port, the amplitude is zero due to destructive interference.\nSquaring these amplitudes to get probabilities:\n\nProbability of both photons in port 3: \\(|0|^2 = 0\\)\nProbability of both photons in port 4: \\(|i|^2 = 1\\)\nProbability of one photon in each port: \\(0\\)\n\nThis means the photons always exit together through the same port (in this case, port 4), never one in each port. The two photons are now entangled - they behave as a single entity rather than two independent particles.\nIf we adjust our phase convention slightly to maintain symmetry between the ports, we get the state:\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|2_3, 0_4\\rangle - |0_3, 2_4\\rangle)\\]\nwhich matches our result from the operator formalism.\nThis phase-dependent quantum interference demonstrates how the simple process of reflection and transmission, combined with the wave nature of quantum particles, leads to complex phenomena like entanglement. The phase factors are crucial - without the \\(\\pi/2\\) phase difference between reflection and transmission, this entanglement would not occur.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "In optics and laser physics, Gaussian beams represent one of the most fundamental and important mathematical descriptions of laser light propagation. They are particularly relevant for understanding laser resonators, optical systems, and coherent light behavior. This section introduces Gaussian beams from first principles and explores their mathematical description.\n\nDerivation from the Helmholtz Equation\nWe begin with the Helmholtz equation, which describes monochromatic electromagnetic waves in a homogeneous medium:\n\\[\\nabla^2 U + k^2 U = 0\\]\nwhere \\(U\\) represents the electric field component, \\(k = 2\\pi/\\lambda\\) is the wave number, and \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of light. For a wave predominantly traveling along the \\(z\\)-axis, we can express the electric field as:\n\\[U(x,y,z) = u(x,y,z)e^{-ikz}\\]\nHere, \\(u(x,y,z)\\) is a complex amplitude function that varies slowly with \\(z\\) compared to the wavelength. Substituting this into the Helmholtz equation and expanding the Laplacian operator yields:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}\\right)(u e^{-ikz}) + k^2 (u e^{-ikz}) = 0\\]\nComputing the derivatives and simplifying:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} - 2ik\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0\\]\n\n\nThe Paraxial Approximation\nThe paraxial approximation applies when the beam’s angular spread is small, meaning the wavefronts are nearly perpendicular to the propagation axis. Mathematically, this means that the amplitude \\(u\\) varies slowly along the propagation direction compared to transverse directions:\n\\[\\left|\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}\\right| \\ll \\left|2k\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right|\\]\nUnder this approximation, the Helmholtz equation simplifies to the paraxial Helmholtz equation:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} - 2ik\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} = 0\\]\nTo solve this equation, we propose the ansatz:\n\\[u(x,y,z) = A(z)\\exp\\left[-\\frac{k}{2q(z)}(x^2 + y^2)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(A(z)\\) and \\(q(z)\\) are complex functions to be determined. Substituting this into the paraxial equation and solving the resulting differential equations:\n\\[\\frac{dq}{dz} = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dA}{dz} = -\\frac{A}{q}\\]\nThese yield solutions \\(q(z) = q_0 + z\\) and \\(A(z) = \\frac{A_0}{q(z)}\\), where \\(q_0\\) and \\(A_0\\) are constants.\nThe complex beam parameter \\(q(z)\\) relates to physical parameters through:\n\\[\\frac{1}{q(z)} = \\frac{1}{R(z)} - i\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi w^2(z)}\\]\nwhere \\(R(z)\\) is the radius of curvature of the wavefront and \\(w(z)\\) is the beam radius at which the intensity falls to \\(1/e^2\\) of its axial value.\nSetting \\(q_0 = iz_0\\) where \\(z_0\\) is the Rayleigh range, we can express these parameters as:\n\\[w(z) = w_0\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)^2}\\]\n\\[R(z) = z\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{z_0}{z}\\right)^2\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(w_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda z_0}{\\pi}}\\) is the beam waist (minimum beam radius).\nThe complete Gaussian beam solution is:\n\\[U(x,y,z) = U_0 \\frac{w_0}{w(z)} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{w^2(z)}\\right] \\exp\\left[-ikz - ik\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2R(z)} + i\\phi(z)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(\\phi(z) = \\arctan(z/z_0)\\) is the Gouy phase shift, representing an additional phase beyond that of a plane wave.\nIn scalar wave theory, the intensity of the Gaussian beam is proportional to the square of the amplitude. It can be calculated as:\n\\[I(x,y,z) = |U(x,y,z)|^2 = I_0\\frac{w_0^2}{w^2(z)}\\exp\\left[-\\frac{2(x^2+y^2)}{w^2(z)}\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(I_0 = |U_0|^2\\) is the peak intensity at the beam waist. This expression shows that the intensity has a Gaussian profile in any transverse plane, with its peak on the beam axis. The intensity falls to \\(1/e^2\\) of its axial value at a radial distance \\(r = w(z)\\) from the axis, which defines the beam radius. The total power carried by the beam is conserved during propagation, but the peak intensity decreases as \\(w(z)\\) increases with distance from the waist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Gaussian Beam Propagation in the x-z Plane\n\n\n\nWe can visualize how a Gaussian beam’s intensity varies across both the propagation direction (z-axis) and transverse direction (x-axis) simultaneously using a 2D contour plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Gaussian Beam Intensity Distribution in the x-z Plane for a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a beam waist of \\(w_0=0.1\\, \\text{mm}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis contour plot illustrates how the Gaussian beam intensity distribution evolves as it propagates. The horizontal axis represents the normalized propagation distance (z/z₀), while the vertical axis shows the normalized transverse distance (x/w₀). The color gradient indicates intensity values, with brighter colors representing higher intensities.\nThe white dashed lines trace the beam width w(z), where the intensity falls to 1/e² (approximately 13.5%) of its value on the beam axis. Note how the beam width reaches its minimum at the beam waist (z=0) and expands as the beam propagates away from the focus.\nThe plot clearly shows that the highest intensity occurs at the beam waist, with the intensity decreasing both as we move away from the center axis and as the beam propagates away from the focal point.\n\n\n\nKey Gaussian Beam Parameters\nThe following table summarizes the important parameters that characterize a Gaussian beam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nExpression\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nBeam waist (\\(w_0\\))\n\nMinimum beam radius at focus (\\(z=0\\))\n\n\nBeam width (\\(w(z)\\))\n\\(w(z) = w_0\\sqrt{1 + \\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)^2}\\)\nBeam radius at position \\(z\\)\n\n\nRayleigh length (\\(z_0\\))\n\\(z_0 = \\frac{\\pi w_0^2}{\\lambda}\\)\nDistance over which beam area doubles\n\n\nRadius of curvature (\\(R(z)\\))\n\\(R(z) = z\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{z_0}{z}\\right)^2\\right]\\)\nRadius of wavefront curvature\n\n\nDivergence angle (\\(\\theta\\))\n\\(\\theta = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi w_0}\\)\nFar-field half-angle of beam spread\n\n\nGouy phase (\\(\\phi(z)\\))\n\\(\\phi(z) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)\\)\nAdditional phase beyond plane wave\n\n\nComplex beam parameter (\\(q(z)\\))\n\\(q(z) = z + iz_0\\)\nCombined parameter for beam properties\n\n\n\nThese parameters are interrelated, forming a complete description of how a Gaussian beam propagates. The Rayleigh length \\(z_0\\) is particularly important as it defines the transition between the near field (where the beam is approximately collimated) and the far field (where the beam diverges linearly). At a distance of one Rayleigh length from the waist, the beam width increases by a factor of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) and the intensity drops to half its maximum value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Gaussian Beam Intensity Profiles\n\n\n\nTo better understand the spatial distribution of intensity in a Gaussian beam, it’s helpful to visualize how the intensity varies along different directions. Here we explore two fundamental cross-sections: the axial intensity along the beam propagation path, and the transverse intensity profile at the beam waist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Gaussian Beam Intensity Profiles for a wavelenght of 632.8 nm and a beam waist of \\(w_0=0.1\\, m\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Gaussian Beam Propagation\n\n\n\nTo better understand the spatial evolution of a Gaussian beam as it propagates, we can visualize how two key parameters change with distance: the beam width \\(w(z)\\) and the wavefront radius of curvature \\(R(z)\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Gaussian Beam Width and Wavefront Curvature for a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a beam waist of \\(w_0=0.1\\, \\text{mm}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe left plot shows how the beam width \\(w(z)\\) evolves with distance from the beam waist. At \\(z = 0\\), the beam is at its narrowest point \\(w_0\\). At the Rayleigh range (\\(z = ±z_0\\)), the width increases to \\(\\sqrt{2}w_0\\). For \\(|z| \\gg z_0\\), the beam width increases approximately linearly with distance, corresponding to a constant far-field divergence angle \\(\\theta = \\lambda/(\\pi w_0)\\).\nThe right plot illustrates the wavefront radius of curvature \\(R(z)\\). At the beam waist, the wavefronts are flat (\\(R = \\infty\\)). The curvature reaches its minimum absolute value of \\(2z_0\\) at \\(z = ±z_0\\). For \\(z &gt; 0\\), \\(R(z)\\) is positive (converging wavefronts), while for \\(z &lt; 0\\), \\(R(z)\\) is negative (diverging wavefronts). As \\(|z|\\) increases, \\(R(z)\\) approaches the asymptotic behavior of a spherical wave, where \\(R(z) \\approx z\\).\nThese parameters together provide a complete description of how the Gaussian beam transforms from a tightly focused wave near the waist to an approximately spherical wave in the far field.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaussian Beam Transformation Through Optical Systems\n\nThe ABCD Matrix Formalism\nThe propagation of Gaussian beams through optical systems can be elegantly described using the ABCD matrix formalism from ray optics. While ray optics typically tracks the position and angle of rays, for Gaussian beams we track the transformation of the complex beam parameter \\(q(z)\\).\nWhen a Gaussian beam passes through an optical system characterized by an ABCD matrix, the complex beam parameter transforms according to:\n\\[q_2 = \\frac{Aq_1 + B}{Cq_1 + D}\\]\nwhere \\(q_1\\) is the initial complex beam parameter and \\(q_2\\) is the transformed parameter. This remarkable result, known as the ABCD law for Gaussian beams, allows us to determine how the beam waist and wavefront curvature change through arbitrary optical systems.\n\n\nCommon Optical Elements\nDifferent optical elements transform Gaussian beams in characteristic ways:\n\nFree-space propagation over distance \\(d\\) is represented by:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & d \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThis matrix describes how the beam naturally diverges as it propagates.\nThin lens with focal length \\(f\\):\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -1/f & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nA lens modifies the wavefront curvature without changing the beam diameter at the lens location.\nCurved interface between media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) and radius of curvature \\(R\\):\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R} & \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\end{pmatrix}\\]\n\nMultiple optical elements can be analyzed by multiplying their respective ABCD matrices in the order encountered by the beam.\n\n\nFocusing of Gaussian Beams\nA particularly important case is the focusing of a Gaussian beam by a lens. If a collimated Gaussian beam with waist \\(w_0\\) is incident on a lens with focal length \\(f\\), the focused beam will have a new waist:\n\\[w_0' = \\frac{\\lambda f}{\\pi w_0}\\]\nlocated approximately at the focal point. This equation highlights the fundamental diffraction limit of focusing: smaller focal spots require larger input beam diameters relative to the wavelength.\nThe transformation matrices enable us to design optical systems that reshape Gaussian beams to desired specifications—expanding, collimating, or focusing them for specific applications. This matrix approach bridges ray optics and wave optics, providing a powerful tool for optical system design with coherent light sources.\n\n\n\nHigher-Order Gaussian Modes\n\nHermite-Gaussian Beams\nHermite-Gaussian modes form a complete set of solutions to the paraxial wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. They can be expressed as:\n\\[U_{nm}(x,y,z) = U_0\\frac{w_0}{w(z)}H_n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}x}{w(z)}\\right)H_m\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}y}{w(z)}\\right) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{w^2(z)}\\right]\\] \\[\\times \\exp\\left[-ikz - ik\\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2R(z)} + i(n+m+1)\\phi(z)\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(H_n\\) and \\(H_m\\) are Hermite polynomials of orders \\(n\\) and \\(m\\). The indices \\(n,m = 0,1,2,...\\) determine the number of nodes in the intensity pattern along \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions. The fundamental Gaussian beam corresponds to \\(n=m=0\\).\nThese modes naturally arise in laser resonators with rectangular symmetry and maintain their intensity pattern during propagation, though they scale in size. Each higher-order mode experiences an additional Gouy phase shift, causing different modes to accumulate phase at different rates during propagation.\n\n\nLaguerre-Gaussian Beams\nIn systems with cylindrical symmetry, Laguerre-Gaussian modes provide a more natural description. In cylindrical coordinates \\((r,\\theta,z)\\), they are given by:\n\\[U_{pl}(r,\\theta,z) = U_0\\frac{w_0}{w(z)}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}r}{w(z)}\\right)^{|l|}L_p^{|l|}\\left(\\frac{2r^2}{w^2(z)}\\right) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{r^2}{w^2(z)}\\right]\\] \\[\\times \\exp\\left[-ikz - ik\\frac{r^2}{2R(z)} + i(2p+|l|+1)\\phi(z) + il\\theta\\right]\\]\nwhere \\(L_p^{|l|}\\) are the associated Laguerre polynomials, \\(p \\geq 0\\) is the radial index determining the number of radial nodes, and \\(l\\) is the azimuthal index that determines the helical structure of the wavefront.\nA remarkable property of Laguerre-Gaussian modes with \\(l \\neq 0\\) is that they carry orbital angular momentum of \\(l\\hbar\\) per photon. The intensity distribution forms a ring-like pattern with a dark center for \\(l \\neq 0\\) due to the phase singularity along the beam axis. As \\(p\\) increases, additional concentric rings appear in the intensity pattern.\nBoth families of higher-order modes are important in modern optics applications, including optical manipulation, quantum information processing, and mode-division multiplexing in optical communications. They represent different orthogonal bases of the same solution space and can be transformed into each other through appropriate optical systems.",

    "text": "Refraction at Spherical Surfaces\nWhen light encounters a spherical boundary between two media, we can analyze its path using Snell’s law and geometric considerations as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Refraction at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nTo determine how an image forms, we need to find where rays originating from a point at distance \\(a\\) from the surface will converge after refraction. Using Snell’s law for a ray hitting the surface at angle \\(\\alpha+\\theta_1\\):\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWhere: \\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nFor practical optical systems, we employ the paraxial approximation, where all angles are assumed small enough that:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta+ O(\\theta^{3}), \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta + O(\\theta^{3}),\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1 + O(\\theta^{2})\\]\nThis simplifies Snell’s law to:\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nAfter appropriate transformations (detailed in the online lecture), we obtain:\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1\\]\nand\n\\[y=y_1=y_2\\]\nThis linear relationship between input (\\(y\\), \\(\\theta_1\\)) and output (\\(y\\),\\(\\theta_2\\)) parameters is a hallmark of paraxial optics and a result of the linearization of Snells law.\n\n\nMatrix Optics\nThe linear relation between input and output parameters allows us to express optical elements as linear transformations (matrices). This approach forms the foundation of matrix optics. For a lens, the matrix representation is:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThis 2×2 matrix is called the ABCD matrix of the lens. Thanks to the linearization of Snell’s law, we can generalize this to any optical element:\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\\n\\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nEach element in the ABCD matrix has a specific physical meaning:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix Element\nPhysical Meaning\n\n\n\n\nA\nMagnification - relates output position to input position\n\n\nB\nPosition-to-angle conversion - relates output position to input angle\n\n\nC\nFocusing power - relates output angle to input position\n\n\nD\nAngular magnification - relates output angle to input angle\n\n\n\nEvery optical element can be characterized by these parameters. For example, a lens has C = -1/f (focusing power), while free space has B = d (position-dependent angle change). An important property is that the determinant of the matrix equals the ratio of refractive indices: det(M) = n₁/n₂, which equals 1 in a single medium.\nHere are the ABCD matrices for common optical elements:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix} =\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & d \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Free space}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Planar interface}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{\\left(n_2-n_1\\right)}{n_2 R} & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Spherical Boundary}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Thin Lens}\n\\]\nFor a system containing multiple optical elements, we simply multiply their matrices in the order that light passes through them:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{M}=\\mathbf{M}_N \\cdots \\mathbf{M}_2 \\mathbf{M}_1\n\\]\nA ray entering the first optical element at a height \\(y_1\\) at an angle \\(\\theta_1\\) is transformed according to the matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}\\) by the whole system. This elegant approach provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex optical systems efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Optical Cloaking with Lens Systems\n\n\n\n\n\nOptical cloaking refers to making objects “invisible” by guiding light rays around them such that to an observer, it appears as if the rays traveled through free space without encountering any object. Using matrix optics, we can design such a system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Example of a practical paraxial cloak. (a)–(c) A hand is cloaked for varying directions, while the background image is transmitted properly.(d) On-axis view of the ray optics cloaking device. (e) Setup using practical, easy to obtain optics, for demonstrating paraxial cloaking principles. (Photos by J. Adam Fenster, videos by Matthew Mann / University of Rochester) Source\n\n\n\nFor perfect optical cloaking, the ABCD matrix of our system must be equivalent to that of free space:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{cloaking} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhere \\(d\\) is the total effective optical path length. Let’s explore why we need exactly 4 lenses to achieve this.\n\nAnalysis of Different Lens Configurations\n1. Single Lens Configuration\nFor a single lens with focal length \\(f\\), the ABCD matrix is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{single} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThis clearly cannot match the free space matrix due to the non-zero \\(C\\) element.\n2. Two-Lens Configuration\nFor two lenses with focal lengths \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) separated by distance \\(d_{12}\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{two} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_2} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_{12} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhen \\(d_{12} = f_1 + f_2\\) (telescopic arrangement), this simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{two} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{f_1}{f_2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{f_2}{f_1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nSince both magnification (\\(A\\)) and angular magnification (\\(D\\)) cannot simultaneously equal 1 while maintaining \\(\\det(\\mathbf{M}) = 1\\), two lenses are insufficient.\n3. Three-Lens Configuration\nWith three lenses, we have more parameters but still need to determine if we can satisfy all constraints simultaneously. For a three-lens system with focal lengths \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), and \\(f_3\\), separated by distances \\(d_{12}\\) and \\(d_{23}\\), the system matrix would be:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{three} =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_3} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_{23} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_2} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_{12} \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f_1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhen multiplied out, the focusing power (C element) of the system is:\n\\[C = -\\frac{1}{f_3} - \\frac{1}{f_2} - \\frac{1}{f_1} + \\frac{d_{12}}{f_1f_2} + \\frac{d_{23}}{f_2f_3} + \\frac{d_{12}d_{23}}{f_1f_2f_3}\\]\nThe magnification (A element) of the system is:\n\\[A = 1 - \\frac{d_{12}}{f_1} - \\frac{d_{23}}{f_2} + \\frac{d_{12}d_{23}}{f_1f_2}\\]\nFor perfect cloaking, we need both C = 0 and A = 1. From A = 1, we can derive:\n\\[\\frac{d_{12}}{f_1} + \\frac{d_{23}}{f_2} - \\frac{d_{12}d_{23}}{f_1f_2} = 0\\]\nSolving for \\(d_{23}\\), we get:\n\\[d_{23} = \\frac{d_{12}/f_1}{1/f_2 - d_{12}/(f_1f_2)}\\]\nSubstituting this into the condition for C = 0, we obtain a complex expression that places constraints on the possible values of \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), and \\(f_3\\). For typical lens configurations, this results in values that are difficult to realize physically, as it often requires either negative separations or negative focal lengths.\nWhile the three-lens system provides more parameters to work with than the two-lens system, the mathematical constraints of simultaneously achieving zero focusing power (C = 0) and unit magnification (A = 1) still make perfect cloaking challenging with conventional optical elements.\n4. Four-Lens Configuration: The Solution\nWe can arrange four lenses in two pairs:\n\nFirst pair (lenses 1 and 2): A beam compressor\nSecond pair (lenses 3 and 4): A beam expander\n\nFor the beam compressor, with lenses at their combined focal length apart:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{comp} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{f_1}{f_2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{f_2}{f_1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nSimilarly, for the beam expander:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{exp} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n-\\frac{f_3}{f_4} & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\frac{f_4}{f_3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nThe combined system matrix is:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{total} = \\mathbf{M}_{exp} \\times \\mathbf{M}_{comp} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\frac{f_1}{f_2} \\times \\frac{f_3}{f_4} & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{f_2}{f_1} \\times \\frac{f_4}{f_3}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nFor perfect cloaking, we need: - \\(\\frac{f_1}{f_2} \\times \\frac{f_3}{f_4} = 1\\) - \\(\\frac{f_2}{f_1} \\times \\frac{f_4}{f_3} = 1\\)\nThis is satisfied when \\(f_1 = f_4\\) and \\(f_2 = f_3\\).\nWith the lenses properly spaced and an additional free space distance \\(d_0\\) between the two pairs, the complete system matrix becomes:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{cloaking} = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & d_0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nWhich perfectly mimics free space propagation, creating the optical cloaking effect.\n\n\nCode\n# Example of optical cloaking with four lenses using raytracing\nfrom raytracing import *\n\n# Define focal lengths (in mm)\nf1 = 200\nf2 = 75\nf3 = f2  # f3 = f2 = 75\nf4 = f1  # f4 = f1 = 200\n\n# Create an optical path\npath = ImagingPath()\n\n# Add the four lenses with proper spacing\npath.append(Space(d=100))  # Initial space before first lens\npath.append(Lens(f=f1, label=f\"f₁={f1}mm\"))\npath.append(Space(d=f1+f2))  # Distance between lens 1 and 2\npath.append(Lens(f=f2, label=f\"f₂={f2}mm\"))\npath.append(Space(d=100))  # Distance between lens pairs (d₀)\npath.append(Lens(f=f3, label=f\"f₃={f3}mm\"))\npath.append(Space(d=f3+f4))  # Distance between lens 3 and 4\npath.append(Lens(f=f4, label=f\"f₄={f4}mm\"))\npath.append(Space(d=100))  # Final space after last lens\n\n# Display the ray path with custom figure size\n\npath.display(raysList=[\n    [Ray(y=5, theta=0)],\n    [Ray(y=-5, theta=0)]\n], interactive=False)\n\n\nBeginnerHint [in figure.py]: Infinite field of view: cannot use limitObjectToFieldOfView=True.

Showing the default ObjectRays instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultifocal Imaging\nWe would like to explore the concept of multifocal imaging to obtain 3D resolution from a single image. In a microscope, an objective lens together with a tube lens is used to focus light from a sample onto a detector. Either the tube lens is no modified to shift the focal plane of the objective lens or one uses multiple tube lenses with different focal lengths with a single objective lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— The multifocal adapter. (a) Composition of the multifocal imaging setup. The multifocal adapter (MFA) is inserted into the light path between a standard dark-field microscope and a camera. (b) Composition of the multifocal adapter. Incoming light from the microscope is infinity projected by the lens f1 and split by three consecutive beam-splitters (b1 = 25/75; b2 = 33/67; b3 = 50/50). Five mirrors (m) guide the light into four separate optical paths. The lens f5 projects the four images onto the camera chip. The inter-plane distance is set by lenses of different focal length (f1 - f4). (c, d) Experimentally acquired (c) and simulated (d) (see Methods) multifocal dark-field images (planes 1 - 4, 20x objective) of a calibration grid at the four focal positions (indicated on the left side), where one of the four focal planes maps the grid sharply. Scale bar represents 20 µm. Experiment was performed six times with similar results. Source\n\n\n\nIn the simplest configuration of an objective lens and a tube lens, the light first travels from the object to the objective lens in free space for a distance \\(s\\), which is represented by\n\n\n\\[\nM_1=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & s\\\\0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nThen it is passing the objective lens with\n\n\n\\[\nM_2=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\\\- \\frac{1}{f_{1}} & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\ntraveling further through free space with distance \\(d\\)\n\n\n\\[\nM_3=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & d\\\\0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nand then hitting the tube lens with\n\n\n\\[\nM_4=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & 0\\\\- \\frac{1}{\\Delta_{ft} + f_{t}} & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\Delta_ft\\) is a parameter modifying the original tube lens focal distance \\(f_t\\). Finally, the light will propagate to the detector at distance \\(f_t\\) from the tube lens\n\n\n\\[\nM_s=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1 & f_{t}\\\\0 & 1\\end{matrix}\\right]\n\\]\n\n\ngicing for the whole system:\n\\[\nM_t=M_4 M_3 M_2 M_1\n\\]\nThe final matrix has again 4 parameters \\(A,B,C\\) and \\(D\\). For sharp imaging the parameter \\(B\\) of the system must be equal to zero, as the outgoing light should be independent of the incoming angle. This is achieved\n\n\n\\[\\delta s=\\frac{f_{1} \\left(\\Delta_{ft} d + \\Delta_{ft} f_{t} + f_{t}^{2}\\right)}{\\Delta_{ft} d - \\Delta_{ft} f_{1} + \\Delta_{ft} f_{t} + f_{t}^{2}}-s_0\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4— Plot of the solution with specific parameter values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe B Parameter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe B parameter is the most direct indicator of a sharp image in matrix optics. For an optical system with ABCD matrix: \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nThe output position is given by: \\[y_2 = Ay_1 + B\\theta_1\\]\nFor an image to be sharp, all rays originating from the same object point must converge to a single image point, regardless of their initial angles. This means that for a given \\(y_1\\) (object position), the final position \\(y_2\\) must be independent of the initial angle \\(\\theta_1\\).\nThis condition is satisfied when B = 0.\nWhen B = 0: - The final position depends only on the initial position (\\(y_2 = Ay_1\\)) - All rays from a point source converge to a single point in the image plane - The imaging is “stigmatic” (point-to-point mapping)\nIn our lens example, the system matrix was: \\[\n\\mathbf{M}_{system} =\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1-\\frac{d}{f} & d \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\]\nFor parallel input rays (different \\(y_1\\) but all \\(\\theta_1 = 0\\)), we needed A = 0 to make them all converge to a single point, which happened when d = f.\nBut for general imaging of points (not just parallel rays), the B = 0 condition is what determines whether the image is sharp. This is why, in optical design, finding conjugate planes (where B = 0) is essential for sharp imaging.",

This equation describes the spatial behavior of monochromatic waves.\n\n\nIntensity of Waves\nThe intensity of a wave at position \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) and time \\(t\\) is defined as:\n\\[\nI(\\mathbf{r},t)=2\\langle u^2(\\mathbf{r},t)\\rangle\n\\]\nwhere \\(I\\) is measured in units of \\(\\left[\\frac{W}{m^2}\\right]\\). The angle brackets \\(\\langle \\ldots \\rangle\\) represent a time average over one oscillation cycle of \\(u\\). For visible light, this averaging occurs over an extremely brief period - for example, light with a wavelength of 600 nm has a cycle duration of just 2 femtoseconds.\nThe optical power \\(P\\) of a wave can be calculated by integrating the intensity over a surface area \\(A\\):\n\\[\nP=\\int_A I(\\mathbf{r},t) \\, dA\n\\]\nInserting the seperation of the complex wavefunction into spatial and temporal components leads to the following expression for the intensity:\n\\[\nI(\\mathbf{r})=|U(\\mathbf{r})|^2\n\\]\nThus the physical quantity forming the spatial and temporal oscillation of the wavefunction is also providing the intensity of the wave when its magnitude is squared. This is a fundamental property of wavefunctions and for example not the case when temperature oscillates in space and time in a medium.\n\n\nWavefronts\nWavefronts are surfaces in space where the phase is constant:\n\\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r})=\\text{const}\n\\]\nTypically, this constant is chosen to represent points of maximum spatial amplitude, such that:\n\\[\n\\phi(\\mathbf{r})=2\\pi q\n\\]\nwhere \\(q\\) is an integer.\nThe direction normal to these wavefronts can be described by the gradient vector:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{n}=\\nabla\\phi=\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y},\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}\\right)\n\\]\nThis vector \\(\\mathbf{n}\\) is always perpendicular to the wavefront surface and points in the direction of wave propagation. The evolution of these wavefronts in time provides important information about the wave’s propagation characteristics.",

    "text": "Snells Law\nThe change in the length of the wavevector has some simple consequence for Snells law. We can write Snells law as\n\\[\nn_1k_0\\sin(\\theta_1)=n_2k_0\\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\nwhere \\(k_0\\) is the wavevector length in vacuum. As the \\(n_1k_0\\) is the magnitude of the wavevector in medium 1, and \\(n_2k_0\\) is the magnitude of the wavevector in medium 2, we can rewrite Snells law as\n\\[\nk_1\\sin(\\theta_1)=k_2\\sin(\\theta_2)\n\\]\nwhich means that the component of the wavevector parallel to the interface is conserved.
