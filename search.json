    "text": "Light has been described through increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks throughout the history of physics. The simplest framework is Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics, which treats light as rays traveling along straight paths and applies geometrical principles to describe interactions with optical elements like lenses and mirrors. Moving beyond this approximation, Wave Optics introduces the wave nature of light, explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction that ray optics cannot address. Electromagnetic Optics further refines our understanding by treating light as electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell’s equations, providing a complete classical description of light-matter interactions. For intense light sources, Nonlinear Optics becomes essential, describing how materials respond nonlinearly to strong electromagnetic fields, giving rise to frequency conversion and other novel effects. Finally, at the most fundamental level, Quantum Optics treats light as consisting of photons—quantum mechanical particles exhibiting both wave and particle properties—essential for understanding phenomena like spontaneous emission, entanglement, and the quantum nature of light-matter interactions. This course will progressively build your understanding through these increasingly sophisticated frameworks.\n\n\nRay optics, or geometric optics, provides a powerful framework for understanding light propagation when the wavelength is much smaller than the dimensions of optical elements involved. In this approach, light travels along straight lines called rays in homogeneous media, with well-defined paths that can be mathematically traced. This description serves as the foundation for analyzing many optical systems, from simple mirrors to complex microscopes and telescopes.\n\n\nFermat’s Principle forms one of the foundations of ray optics, stating that light travels along the route that takes the total optical path length between any two points to an extremum (commonly a minimum). This optical path length, expressed mathematically as \\(\\int_C n(s)ds\\), represents the effective distance light traverses through media of varying refractive indices. When this quantity is divided by the vacuum speed of light \\(c_0\\), it yields the total travel time required for light to journey between those points.\nIn its integral form:\n\\[\\delta\\int_C n(s)ds = 0\\]\nwhere \\(n(s)\\) is the refractive index along path \\(C\\) and \\(ds\\) is the differential path length.\nThe same principle can be expressed as a differential equation that describes how light bends in media with varying refractive indices:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis equation shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index.

The total path length is \\(L = |AP| + |PB|\\).\nLet’s establish a coordinate system where the mirror lies along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((-a, h_1)\\) and point B is at \\((b, h_2)\\), with the reflection point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total path length is:\n\\[L(x) = \\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2} + \\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, the actual path minimizes \\(L\\), so we differentiate with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} - \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\]\nNow, let’s interpret this geometrically. The angle of incidence \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle between the incident ray AP and the normal to the mirror (y-axis). Similarly, the angle of reflection \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle between the reflected ray PB and the normal.\nFrom trigonometry: - \\(\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}}\\) - \\(\\sin(\\theta_r) = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\)\nTherefore, our minimization condition directly yields: \\[\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sin(\\theta_r)\\]\nSince both angles are measured in the same quadrant (from the normal to the mirror), this equality implies: \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nThis is the law of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nLaw of Reflection: The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\n\n\n\nRefraction: Between media with different refractive indices, Fermat’s Principle yields Snell’s law:\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_optical_path(x, start, end, n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total optical path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = n1 * np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)  # Optical path in medium 1\n    d2 = n2 * np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)      # Optical path in medium 2\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, -3)\n\n# Define refractive indices\nn1 = 1.0  # Medium 1 (above interface)\nn2 = 1.5  # Medium 2 (below interface)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate optical path lengths\noptical_paths = [calculate_optical_path(x, start_point, end_point, n1, n2) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(optical_paths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5, alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-', lw=1)\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go', label='end')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro', label='refraction')\n\n# Calculate and draw angles\n# Incident ray\ndx1 = min_x - start_point[0]\ndy1 = 0 - start_point[1]\nincident_angle = np.arctan2(-dy1, dx1)\ntheta1 = np.pi/2 - incident_angle\n\n# Refracted ray\ndx2 = end_point[0] - min_x\ndy2 = end_point[1] - 0\nrefracted_angle = np.arctan2(dy2, dx2)\ntheta2 = np.pi/2 + refracted_angle\n\n# Draw angle arcs\n\n# Add angle labels\nax.text(min_x + 0.3, 0.3, r'$\\theta_1$', color='blue')\nax.text(min_x - 0.5, -0.3, r'$\\theta_2$', color='green')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-3, 0.5, f\"n₁ = {n1}\", color='blue')\nax.text(-3, -0.5, f\"n₂ = {n2}\", color='green')\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Snell’s Law from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefraction Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor refraction between two media with different refractive indices, we apply Fermat’s principle to find the path that minimizes the total optical path length. Consider a ray traveling from point A in medium 1 to point B in medium 2, with refraction occurring at point P on the interface, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-refraction}\\).\nThe total optical path length is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nTo determine the exact refraction point P that minimizes this path, we establish a coordinate system with the interface along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((x_A, y_A)\\) where \\(y_A &gt; 0\\), and point B is at \\((x_B, y_B)\\) where \\(y_B &lt; 0\\), with the refraction point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total optical path length is:\n\\[L(x) = n_1\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2} + n_2\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, we minimize \\(L\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(x\\) and setting it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1\\frac{x-x_A}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} - n_2\\frac{x_B-x}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1(x-x_A)}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} = \\frac{n_2(x_B-x)}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\]\nFrom geometry, we can identify the sine of the angles of incidence and refraction: - \\(\\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{|AP|} = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}}\\) - \\(\\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{|PB|} = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\)\nTaking the sign into account based on our coordinate system, our minimization condition becomes:\n\\[n_1\\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2\\sin(\\theta_2)\\]\nThis is Snell’s law, stating that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\nSnell’s Law: The ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the reciprocal of the ratio of the refractive indices. \\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the differential ray equation from Fermat’s integral principle, we apply the calculus of variations. Starting with the optical path length functional:\n\\[L = \\int_C n(s)ds = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\) parametrizes the path. The term \\(\\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right|\\) represents the differential element of arc length \\(ds\\) along the path, so \\(ds = \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\). This parametrization allows us to convert the path integral over the curve \\(C\\) into a definite integral over the parameter \\(t\\). According to Fermat’s principle, the true path makes this integral stationary (δL = 0).\nConsider a small variation in the path: \\(\\mathbf{r}(t) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)\\) where \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}(t_1) = \\mathbf{\\eta}(t_2) = 0\\) (fixed endpoints). Expanding the variation of the integral to first order in ε:\n\\[\\delta L = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t))\\right| dt\\]\nUsing the chain rule and reparametrizing with arc length \\(s\\) (where \\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) is a unit vector), the stationarity condition leads to:\n\\[\\int_C \\left[ \\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{\\eta} - \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\eta} \\right] ds = 0\\]\nSince this must hold for any variation \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}\\), we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, directly analogous to how a mechanical particle’s trajectory is affected by a potential field in classical mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELFOC Gradient Index Lens\n\n\n\n\n\nSELFOC (SELf-FOCusing) gradient-index fibers are interesting optical elements that guide light through a continuous refraction process rather than discrete refractions at interfaces. Let me demonstrate how Fermat’s principle can be used to determine the ray paths in these fibers. A SELFOC fiber has a radially varying refractive index, typically following a parabolic profile:\n\\[n(r) = n_0\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 r^2\\right)\\]\nwhere: - \\(n_0\\) is the refractive index at the central axis - \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the axis - \\(\\alpha\\) is the gradient constant that determines how quickly the index decreases with radius\n\n\nFor a medium with a spatially varying refractive index, Fermat’s principle states that light follows the path that minimizes the optical path length:\n\\[\\delta \\int_C n(r) ds = 0\\]\nThis yields the differential equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\n\n\n\nFor our parabolic index profile, the gradient of the refractive index is:\n\\[\\nabla n = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -n_0\\alpha^2 r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\]\nUsing cylindrical coordinates with z along the fiber axis, and assuming the paraxial approximation (rays make small angles with the z-axis), we can simplify the ray equation to:\n\\[\\frac{d^2r}{dz^2} + \\alpha^2 r = 0\\]\nThis is the equation for a harmonic oscillator, which has the solution:\n\\[r(z) = r_0 \\cos(\\alpha z) + \\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha} \\sin(\\alpha z)\\]\nwhere \\(r_0\\) is the initial radial position and \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the ray with respect to the fiber axis.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Central refractive index\nalpha = 0.3  # Gradient constant (mm^-1)\nlength = 30  # Length of fiber (mm)\nradius = 1.5  # Radius of fiber (mm)\n\n# Create a grid for visualization\nz = np.linspace(0, length, 300)\nr_grid = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\nZ, R = np.meshgrid(z, r_grid)\n\n# Calculate refractive index at each point\nN = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * R)**2)\n\n# Initialize ray paths\nr0_values = [0.6, 1.0, 1.4]  # Initial radial positions\ntheta0_values = [0, 0.2, -0.2]    # Initial angles (all parallel to axis)\n\n# Plot setup\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(15, 5), gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [3, 1]})\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile in the first subplot\ncmap = plt.cm.viridis\nextent = [0, length, -radius, radius]\nim = ax1.imshow(np.vstack((N[::-1], N)), extent=extent,\n               aspect='auto', cmap=cmap, origin='lower',alpha=0.2)\nfig.colorbar(im, ax=ax1, label='n(y)')\n\n# Plot ray paths\nfor r0, theta0 in zip(r0_values, theta0_values):\n    # Calculate ray path\n    r = r0 * np.cos(alpha * z) + (theta0/alpha) * np.sin(alpha * z)\n\n    # Plot ray path\n    ax1.plot(z, r, 'r-')\n    ax1.plot(z, -r, 'r-')  # Symmetric ray below axis\n\n# Add labels and title for first subplot\nax1.set_xlabel('z [mm]')\nax1.set_ylabel('y [mm]')\n\n# For the right subplot, plot r-position vs refractive index\n# Create a finer array of radial positions for a smooth curve\nr_positions = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\n# Calculate refractive index at each radial position\nn_profile = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * r_positions)**2)\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile\nax2.plot( n_profile,r_positions, 'k-')\nax2.plot( n_profile,-r_positions, 'k-')\n\n# Set labels for the index profile subplot\nax2.set_xlabel('y [mm]')\nax2.set_ylabel('n(y)')\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Ray-path inside a SELFOC gradient index optical fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differential form of Fermat’s principle:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nreveals a profound analogy with Newton’s Second Law of motion:\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} = m\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}\\]\nThis comparison, sometimes called “F=ma optics,” illustrates how light rays follow trajectories mathematically similar to those of mechanical particles. To see this connection more clearly, we can expand the ray equation as:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n\\]\nUsing the chain rule, \\(\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\), and denoting \\(\\mathbf{t} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) as the unit tangent vector along the ray:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t} = \\nabla n\\]\nRearranging to isolate the ray curvature term:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\nabla n - (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t}\\]\nThe right side represents the component of \\(\\nabla n\\) perpendicular to the ray direction, which we can denote as \\((\\nabla n)_\\perp\\). Therefore:\n\\[\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\frac{1}{n}(\\nabla n)_\\perp\\]\nThis equation reveals that the ray curvature is proportional to the perpendicular component of the refractive index gradient and inversely proportional to the refractive index itself. Crucially, this shows that light rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, not away from them.\nThis behavior explains many optical phenomena:\n\nLight bending toward the normal when entering a medium with higher refractive index\nLight guiding in optical fibers where light remains confined in the higher-index core\nFormation of mirages where light curves toward the denser air near the ground\nFocusing in gradient-index (GRIN) lenses where the refractive index decreases radially from the center\n\nWhile the mathematical form resembles Newton’s equation for particle motion, the analogy must be carefully interpreted: unlike particles that accelerate toward lower potential energy, light rays curve toward regions of higher refractive index.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Base refractive index (center value)\nn_min = 1.0  # Minimum refractive index (at edges)\nx_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\ny_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)\n\n# Calculate radial distance from center\nR = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)\n# Max radius in our plot\nR_max = 5*np.sqrt(2)\n\n# Create a refractive index profile that decreases with radius\n# but never goes below n_min\ngradient_strength = (n0 - n_min)/R_max  # Calculate appropriate gradient strength\nn = n0 - gradient_strength * R  # Linear decrease with radius\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 10))\n\n# Plot the refractive index as a contour plot\ncontour = ax.contourf(X, Y, n, 20, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.3)\ncbar = fig.colorbar(contour, ax=ax, label='Refractive Index')\n\n# Calculate and plot some ray trajectories\n# We'll simulate the paths by numerical integration\n\ndef ray_path(r0, v0, steps=1000, dt=0.05):\n    \"\"\"Simulate a ray path through the medium\"\"\"\n    r = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    v = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    r[0] = r0\n    v[0] = v0 / np.linalg.norm(v0)  # Normalize velocity\n\n    for i in range(1, steps):\n        # Get position\n        x, y = r[i-1]\n        if abs(x) &gt;= 5 or abs(y) &gt;= 5:\n            return r[:i]\n\n        # Approximate gradient of n at this point\n        eps = 0.01\n        nx_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x+eps)**2 + y**2)\n        nx_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x-eps)**2 + y**2)\n        ny_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y+eps)**2)\n        ny_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y-eps)**2)\n\n        grad_n_x = (nx_plus - nx_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n_y = (ny_plus - ny_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n = np.array([grad_n_x, grad_n_y])\n\n        # Current n value\n        current_n = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n\n        # Calculate the perpendicular component of gradient\n        t = v[i-1] / np.linalg.norm(v[i-1])  # Tangent vector (normalized velocity)\n        grad_n_parallel = np.dot(grad_n, t) * t  # Component along ray direction\n        grad_n_perp = grad_n - grad_n_parallel  # Perpendicular component\n\n        # Update velocity - rays bend toward higher refractive index\n        a = grad_n_perp / current_n\n        v[i] = v[i-1] + a * dt\n        v[i] = v[i] / np.linalg.norm(v[i])  # Ensure unit speed\n\n        # Update position\n        r[i] = r[i-1] + v[i] * dt\n\n    return r\n\n# Calculate several ray paths\nstart_positions = [\n    [-4, 2.5], [-4, 1.5], [-4, 0.5],\n    [-4, -0.5], [-4, -1.5], [-4, -2.5]\n]\npaths = []\n\nfor start_pos in start_positions:\n    path = ray_path(start_pos, [1, 0], steps=500)\n    paths.append(path)\n    ax.plot(path[:, 0], path[:, 1], 'r-', linewidth=1.5)\n\n# Add start points\nfor pos in start_positions:\n    ax.plot(pos[0], pos[1], 'ro')\n\n# Add axis labels\nax.set_xlabel('x position')\nax.set_ylabel('y position')\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-5, 5)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4— F=ma optics - Light rays (red) following paths toward regions of higher refractive index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important optical elements are lenses, which come in many different flavors.

We begin with Snell’s law for the geometry:\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWe define key relationships:\n\\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nTo simplify this, we employ the paraxial approximation, which assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use first-order approximations of trigonometric functions, effectively linearizing them:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta+ O(\\theta^{3}), \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta + O(\\theta^{3}),\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1 + O(\\theta^{2})\\]\nThis approach, common in optics, significantly simplifies our calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nWith the help of these approximations we can write Snell’s law for the curved surface as\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2).\\]\nWith some slight transformation which you will find in the video of the online lecture we obtain, therefore,\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1,\\]\nwhich is a purely linear equation in \\(y\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParaxial Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paraxial approximation is a fundamental simplification in optics that assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use linear approximations for trigonometric functions, significantly simplifying calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nTo visualize the validity of this approximation, let’s examine two plots:\n\nThe first plot compares sin(θ) (blue line) with its linear approximation θ (red dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to π/2 radians.\nThe second plot shows the absolute error between sin(θ) and θ.\n\nThese plots demonstrate that:\n\nFor small angles (roughly up to 0.5 radians or about 30 degrees), the approximation is very close to the actual sine function.\nThe error increases rapidly for larger angles, indicating the limitations of the paraxial approximation.\n\nIn most optical systems, especially those involving lenses, the angles of incident and refracted rays are typically small enough for this approximation to be valid. However, it’s important to be aware of its limitations when dealing with wide-angle optical systems or scenarios where precision is critical.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define the range of angles (in radians)\ntheta = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta) and theta (linear approximation)\nsin_theta = np.sin(theta)\nlinear_approx = theta\n\n# Calculate the absolute error\nerror = np.abs(sin_theta - linear_approx)\n\n# Create the plot with two subplots side by side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7.5, 4))\n\n# Plot sin(theta) and theta on the first subplot\nax1.plot(theta, sin_theta, label='sin(θ)', color='blue')\nax1.plot(theta, linear_approx, label='θ', color='red', linestyle='--')\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\sin(x),x$')\nax1.legend()\n\n# Plot the error on the second subplot\nax2.plot(theta, error, label='Absolute Error', color='green')\nax2.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax2.set_ylabel('|sin(θ) - θ|')\nax2.legend()\n\n# Adjust the layout and display the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of the paraxial approximation plotting the \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the linear approximation \\(\\theta\\) (dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider light originating from a point at distance \\(y\\) from the optical axis. We’ll analyze two rays: one traveling parallel to the optical axis and hitting the spherical surface at height \\(y\\), and another incident at \\(y=0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6— Image formation at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nApplying our derived formula to these two cases:\nFor the parallel ray (\\(\\theta_1=0\\)):\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2}\\frac{y}{R}\\] \\[\\theta_2=\\frac{y+\\Delta y}{b}\\]\nEquating these expressions:\n\\[\\frac{y+\\Delta y}{b}=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2}\\frac{y}{R}\\]\nFor the ray through the center (\\(y=0\\)):\n\\[n_2\\frac{\\Delta y}{b}=n_1\\frac{y}{a}\\]\nCombining these equations yields the imaging equation for a curved surface:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a}+\\frac{n_2}{b}=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nWe can define a new quantity, the focal length, which depends only on the properties of the curved surface:\n\\[f=\\frac{n_2}{n_2-n_1}R\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation for Spherical Refracting Surface\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the spherical refracting surface:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a}+\\frac{n_2}{b}\\approx\\frac{n_2}{f}\\]\nwhere the focal length of the refracting surface is given by:\n\\[f=\\frac{n_2}{n_2-n_1}R\\]\nin the paraxial approximation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our previous calculation we have found a linear relation between the incident angle \\(\\theta_1\\) with the optical axis, the incident height of the ray \\(y\\) and the outgoing angle \\(\\theta_2\\):\nAnalyzing refraction in a lens involves two spherical surfaces. Light initially travels from a medium with refractive index \\(n_1\\) into the lens material with index \\(n_2\\). The first surface’s radius, \\(R_1\\), is typically positive for a convex surface facing the incident light.\nAt the second surface, the outgoing angle from the first refraction becomes the incident angle for the second refraction. Here, light travels from \\(n_2\\) back into \\(n_1\\). The radius \\(R_2\\) of this surface often has a negative value in a converging lens due to its opposite curvature relative to the optical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7— Refraction on two spherical surfaces.\n\n\n\nFor thin lenses, where the thickness \\(d\\) is much smaller than \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) (\\(d \\ll R_1, R_2\\)), we can simplify our analysis. We assume that the height of the ray at both surfaces is approximately equal (\\(y \\approx y'\\)), neglecting the displacement inside the lens.\nThis simplification allows us to treat all refraction as occurring on a single plane at the lens center, known as the principal plane. This concept, illustrated by the dashed line in the figure, greatly simplifies optical calculations and ray tracing for thin lenses.\nThe radii’s sign convention (positive for convex surfaces facing incident light, negative for concave) and this two-surface analysis form the basis for the thin lens formula. This formula relates object distance, image distance, and focal length, encapsulating the lens’s imaging properties.\nThe result of the above calculation is leading to the imaging equation for the thin lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation for Thin Lens\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the thin lens:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left (\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right )=\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLensmaker equation\n\n\n\nThe focal length of a thin lens is calculated by the lensmaker equation: \\[f=\\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left ( \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2 -R_1}\\right)\\]\nin the paraxial approximation.\n\n\n\n\nImages of objects can be now constructed if we refer to rays which do not emerge from a position on the optical axis only. In this case, we consider three different rays (two are actually enough). If we use as in the case of a concave mirror a central and a parallel ray, we will find a position where all rays cross on the other side. The conversion of the rays is exactly the same as in the case of a spherical mirror. The relation between the position of the object and the image along the optical axis is described by the imaging equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8— Image construction on a thin lens.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the concave mirror, we may now also find out the image size or the magnification of the lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnification of a Lens\n\n\n\nThe magnification is given by:\n\\[M=\\frac{h_{\\rm image}}{h_{\\rm object}}=-\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{f}{f-a}\\]\nwhere the negative sign is the result of the reverse orientation of the real images created by a lens.\n\n\nAccording to our previous consideration \\(M&lt;0\\) corresponds to a reversed image, while it is upright as the object for \\(M&gt;0\\).

The linear relation yields a great opportunity to express optical elements in terms of linear transformations (matrices). This is the basis of matrix optics.

    "text": "Light has been described through increasingly sophisticated theoretical frameworks throughout the history of physics. The simplest framework is Ray Optics or Geometrical Optics, which treats light as rays traveling along straight paths and applies geometrical principles to describe interactions with optical elements like lenses and mirrors. Moving beyond this approximation, Wave Optics introduces the wave nature of light, explaining phenomena such as interference and diffraction that ray optics cannot address. Electromagnetic Optics further refines our understanding by treating light as electromagnetic waves governed by Maxwell’s equations, providing a complete classical description of light-matter interactions. For intense light sources, Nonlinear Optics becomes essential, describing how materials respond nonlinearly to strong electromagnetic fields, giving rise to frequency conversion and other novel effects. Finally, at the most fundamental level, Quantum Optics treats light as consisting of photons—quantum mechanical particles exhibiting both wave and particle properties—essential for understanding phenomena like spontaneous emission, entanglement, and the quantum nature of light-matter interactions. This course will progressively build your understanding through these increasingly sophisticated frameworks.\n\n\nRay optics, or geometric optics, provides a powerful framework for understanding light propagation when the wavelength is much smaller than the dimensions of optical elements involved. In this approach, light travels along straight lines called rays in homogeneous media, with well-defined paths that can be mathematically traced. This description serves as the foundation for analyzing many optical systems, from simple mirrors to complex microscopes and telescopes.\n\n\nFermat’s Principle forms one of the foundations of ray optics, stating that light travels along the route that takes the total optical path length between any two points to an extremum (commonly a minimum). This optical path length, expressed mathematically as \\(\\int_C n(s)ds\\), represents the effective distance light traverses through media of varying refractive indices. When this quantity is divided by the vacuum speed of light \\(c_0\\), it yields the total travel time required for light to journey between those points.\nIn its integral form:\n\\[\\delta\\int_C n(s)ds = 0\\]\nwhere \\(n(s)\\) is the refractive index along path \\(C\\) and \\(ds\\) is the differential path length.\nThe same principle can be expressed as a differential equation that describes how light bends in media with varying refractive indices:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis equation shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index. In homogeneous media (\\(\\nabla n = 0\\)), it simplifies to \\(\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = 0\\), confirming that light follows straight lines.\n\n\n\nReflection: At a planar interface, Fermat’s Principle directly yields the law of reflection:\n\\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the surface.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_path_length(x, start, end):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)\n    d2 = np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, 3)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate path lengths\npath_lengths = [calculate_path_length(x, start_point, end_point) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(path_lengths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5,alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-')\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start point')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go',  label='end point')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro',  label='reflection Point')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-0.7, -1, \"mirror\")\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1— Fermat’s principle for reflection of light at an interface\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor reflection at a planar interface, we consider a ray traveling from point A to point B via reflection at point P on a mirror, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-reflection}\\). The total path length is \\(L = |AP| + |PB|\\).\nLet’s establish a coordinate system where the mirror lies along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((-a, h_1)\\) and point B is at \\((b, h_2)\\), with the reflection point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total path length is:\n\\[L(x) = \\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2} + \\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, the actual path minimizes \\(L\\), so we differentiate with respect to \\(x\\) and set it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} - \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}} = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\]\nNow, let’s interpret this geometrically. The angle of incidence \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle between the incident ray AP and the normal to the mirror (y-axis). Similarly, the angle of reflection \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle between the reflected ray PB and the normal.\nFrom trigonometry: - \\(\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\frac{x+a}{\\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + h_1^2}}\\) - \\(\\sin(\\theta_r) = \\frac{b-x}{\\sqrt{(b-x)^2 + h_2^2}}\\)\nTherefore, our minimization condition directly yields: \\[\\sin(\\theta_i) = \\sin(\\theta_r)\\]\nSince both angles are measured in the same quadrant (from the normal to the mirror), this equality implies: \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nThis is the law of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.\nLaw of Reflection: The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. \\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\n\n\n\nRefraction: Between media with different refractive indices, Fermat’s Principle yields Snell’s law:\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_optical_path(x, start, end, n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total optical path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = n1 * np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)  # Optical path in medium 1\n    d2 = n2 * np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)      # Optical path in medium 2\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(15, 10))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, -3)\n\n# Define refractive indices\nn1 = 1.0  # Medium 1 (above interface)\nn2 = 1.5  # Medium 2 (below interface)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate optical path lengths\noptical_paths = [calculate_optical_path(x, start_point, end_point, n1, n2) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(optical_paths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5, alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-', lw=1)\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go', label='end')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro', label='refraction')\n\n# Calculate and draw angles\n# Incident ray\ndx1 = min_x - start_point[0]\ndy1 = 0 - start_point[1]\nincident_angle = np.arctan2(-dy1, dx1)\ntheta1 = np.pi/2 - incident_angle\n\n# Refracted ray\ndx2 = end_point[0] - min_x\ndy2 = end_point[1] - 0\nrefracted_angle = np.arctan2(dy2, dx2)\ntheta2 = np.pi/2 + refracted_angle\n\n# Draw angle arcs\n\n# Add angle labels\nax.text(min_x + 0.3, 0.3, r'$\\theta_1$', color='blue')\nax.text(min_x - 0.5, -0.3, r'$\\theta_2$', color='green')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-3, 0.5, f\"n₁ = {n1}\", color='blue')\nax.text(-3, -0.5, f\"n₂ = {n2}\", color='green')\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2— Snell’s Law from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefraction Law Derivation\n\n\n\n\n\nFor refraction between two media with different refractive indices, we apply Fermat’s principle to find the path that minimizes the total optical path length. Consider a ray traveling from point A in medium 1 to point B in medium 2, with refraction occurring at point P on the interface, as illustrated in Fig. \\(\\ref{fig-fermat-refraction}\\).\nThe total optical path length is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nTo determine the exact refraction point P that minimizes this path, we establish a coordinate system with the interface along the x-axis at y = 0. If point A is at coordinates \\((x_A, y_A)\\) where \\(y_A &gt; 0\\), and point B is at \\((x_B, y_B)\\) where \\(y_B &lt; 0\\), with the refraction point P at \\((x, 0)\\), the total optical path length is:\n\\[L(x) = n_1\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2} + n_2\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s Principle, we minimize \\(L\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(x\\) and setting it equal to zero:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = n_1\\frac{x-x_A}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} - n_2\\frac{x_B-x}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}} = 0\\]\nRearranging this equation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1(x-x_A)}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} = \\frac{n_2(x_B-x)}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\]\nFrom geometry, we can identify the sine of the angles of incidence and refraction: - \\(\\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{|AP|} = \\frac{|x-x_A|}{\\sqrt{(x-x_A)^2 + y_A^2}}\\) - \\(\\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{|PB|} = \\frac{|x_B-x|}{\\sqrt{(x_B-x)^2 + y_B^2}}\\)\nTaking the sign into account based on our coordinate system, our minimization condition becomes:\n\\[n_1\\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2\\sin(\\theta_2)\\]\nThis is Snell’s law, stating that the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the ratio of the refractive indices of the two media.\nSnell’s Law: The ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction equals the reciprocal of the ratio of the refractive indices. \\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the differential ray equation from Fermat’s integral principle, we apply the calculus of variations. Starting with the optical path length functional:\n\\[L = \\int_C n(s)ds = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\]\nWhere \\(\\mathbf{r}(t)\\) parametrizes the path. The term \\(\\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right|\\) represents the differential element of arc length \\(ds\\) along the path, so \\(ds = \\left|\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt}\\right| dt\\). This parametrization allows us to convert the path integral over the curve \\(C\\) into a definite integral over the parameter \\(t\\). According to Fermat’s principle, the true path makes this integral stationary (δL = 0).\nConsider a small variation in the path: \\(\\mathbf{r}(t) \\rightarrow \\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)\\) where \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}(t_1) = \\mathbf{\\eta}(t_2) = 0\\) (fixed endpoints). Expanding the variation of the integral to first order in ε:\n\\[\\delta L = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}\\bigg|_{\\epsilon=0} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} n(\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t)) \\left|\\frac{d}{dt}(\\mathbf{r}(t) + \\epsilon\\mathbf{\\eta}(t))\\right| dt\\]\nUsing the chain rule and reparametrizing with arc length \\(s\\) (where \\(\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) is a unit vector), the stationarity condition leads to:\n\\[\\int_C \\left[ \\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{\\eta} - \\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{\\eta} \\right] ds = 0\\]\nSince this must hold for any variation \\(\\mathbf{\\eta}\\), we obtain the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nThis shows that rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, directly analogous to how a mechanical particle’s trajectory is affected by a potential field in classical mechanics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELFOC Gradient Index Lens\n\n\n\n\n\nSELFOC (SELf-FOCusing) gradient-index fibers are interesting optical elements that guide light through a continuous refraction process rather than discrete refractions at interfaces. Let me demonstrate how Fermat’s principle can be used to determine the ray paths in these fibers. A SELFOC fiber has a radially varying refractive index, typically following a parabolic profile:\n\\[n(r) = n_0\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\alpha^2 r^2\\right)\\]\nwhere: - \\(n_0\\) is the refractive index at the central axis - \\(r\\) is the radial distance from the axis - \\(\\alpha\\) is the gradient constant that determines how quickly the index decreases with radius\n\n\nFor a medium with a spatially varying refractive index, Fermat’s principle states that light follows the path that minimizes the optical path length:\n\\[\\delta \\int_C n(r) ds = 0\\]\nThis yields the differential equation:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\n\n\n\nFor our parabolic index profile, the gradient of the refractive index is:\n\\[\\nabla n = \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial r}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}} = -n_0\\alpha^2 r \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\]\nUsing cylindrical coordinates with z along the fiber axis, and assuming the paraxial approximation (rays make small angles with the z-axis), we can simplify the ray equation to:\n\\[\\frac{d^2r}{dz^2} + \\alpha^2 r = 0\\]\nThis is the equation for a harmonic oscillator, which has the solution:\n\\[r(z) = r_0 \\cos(\\alpha z) + \\frac{\\theta_0}{\\alpha} \\sin(\\alpha z)\\]\nwhere \\(r_0\\) is the initial radial position and \\(\\theta_0\\) is the initial angle of the ray with respect to the fiber axis.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Central refractive index\nalpha = 0.3  # Gradient constant (mm^-1)\nlength = 30  # Length of fiber (mm)\nradius = 1.5  # Radius of fiber (mm)\n\n# Create a grid for visualization\nz = np.linspace(0, length, 300)\nr_grid = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\nZ, R = np.meshgrid(z, r_grid)\n\n# Calculate refractive index at each point\nN = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * R)**2)\n\n# Initialize ray paths\nr0_values = [0.6, 1.0, 1.4]  # Initial radial positions\ntheta0_values = [0, 0.2, -0.2]    # Initial angles (all parallel to axis)\n\n# Plot setup\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(15, 5), gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [3, 1]})\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile in the first subplot\ncmap = plt.cm.viridis\nextent = [0, length, -radius, radius]\nim = ax1.imshow(np.vstack((N[::-1], N)), extent=extent,\n               aspect='auto', cmap=cmap, origin='lower',alpha=0.2)\nfig.colorbar(im, ax=ax1, label='n(y)')\n\n# Plot ray paths\nfor r0, theta0 in zip(r0_values, theta0_values):\n    # Calculate ray path\n    r = r0 * np.cos(alpha * z) + (theta0/alpha) * np.sin(alpha * z)\n\n    # Plot ray path\n    ax1.plot(z, r, 'r-')\n    ax1.plot(z, -r, 'r-')  # Symmetric ray below axis\n\n# Add labels and title for first subplot\nax1.set_xlabel('z [mm]')\nax1.set_ylabel('y [mm]')\n\n# For the right subplot, plot r-position vs refractive index\n# Create a finer array of radial positions for a smooth curve\nr_positions = np.linspace(0, radius, 100)\n# Calculate refractive index at each radial position\nn_profile = n0 * (1 - 0.5 * (alpha * r_positions)**2)\n\n# Plot the refractive index profile\nax2.plot( n_profile,r_positions, 'k-')\nax2.plot( n_profile,-r_positions, 'k-')\n\n# Set labels for the index profile subplot\nax2.set_xlabel('y [mm]')\nax2.set_ylabel('n(y)')\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3— Ray-path inside a SELFOC gradient index optical fiber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe differential form of Fermat’s principle:\n\\[\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\right) = \\nabla n\\]\nreveals a profound analogy with Newton’s Second Law of motion:\n\\[\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} = m\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{dt^2}\\]\nThis comparison, sometimes called “F=ma optics,” illustrates how light rays follow trajectories mathematically similar to those of mechanical particles. To see this connection more clearly, we can expand the ray equation as:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n\\]\nUsing the chain rule, \\(\\frac{dn}{ds} = \\nabla n \\cdot \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\), and denoting \\(\\mathbf{t} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}\\) as the unit tangent vector along the ray:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} + (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t} = \\nabla n\\]\nRearranging to isolate the ray curvature term:\n\\[n\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\nabla n - (\\nabla n \\cdot \\mathbf{t})\\mathbf{t}\\]\nThe right side represents the component of \\(\\nabla n\\) perpendicular to the ray direction, which we can denote as \\((\\nabla n)_\\perp\\). Therefore:\n\\[\\frac{d^2\\mathbf{r}}{ds^2} = \\frac{1}{n}(\\nabla n)_\\perp\\]\nThis equation reveals that the ray curvature is proportional to the perpendicular component of the refractive index gradient and inversely proportional to the refractive index itself. Crucially, this shows that light rays bend toward regions of higher refractive index, not away from them.\nThis behavior explains many optical phenomena:\n\nLight bending toward the normal when entering a medium with higher refractive index\nLight guiding in optical fibers where light remains confined in the higher-index core\nFormation of mirages where light curves toward the denser air near the ground\nFocusing in gradient-index (GRIN) lenses where the refractive index decreases radially from the center\n\nWhile the mathematical form resembles Newton’s equation for particle motion, the analogy must be carefully interpreted: unlike particles that accelerate toward lower potential energy, light rays curve toward regions of higher refractive index.\n\n\nCode\n# Parameters\nn0 = 1.5  # Base refractive index (center value)\nn_min = 1.0  # Minimum refractive index (at edges)\nx_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\ny_range = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)\n\n# Calculate radial distance from center\nR = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)\n# Max radius in our plot\nR_max = 5*np.sqrt(2)\n\n# Create a refractive index profile that decreases with radius\n# but never goes below n_min\ngradient_strength = (n0 - n_min)/R_max  # Calculate appropriate gradient strength\nn = n0 - gradient_strength * R  # Linear decrease with radius\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 10))\n\n# Plot the refractive index as a contour plot\ncontour = ax.contourf(X, Y, n, 20, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.3)\ncbar = fig.colorbar(contour, ax=ax, label='Refractive Index')\n\n# Calculate and plot some ray trajectories\n# We'll simulate the paths by numerical integration\n\ndef ray_path(r0, v0, steps=1000, dt=0.05):\n    \"\"\"Simulate a ray path through the medium\"\"\"\n    r = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    v = np.zeros((steps, 2))\n    r[0] = r0\n    v[0] = v0 / np.linalg.norm(v0)  # Normalize velocity\n\n    for i in range(1, steps):\n        # Get position\n        x, y = r[i-1]\n        if abs(x) &gt;= 5 or abs(y) &gt;= 5:\n            return r[:i]\n\n        # Approximate gradient of n at this point\n        eps = 0.01\n        nx_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x+eps)**2 + y**2)\n        nx_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt((x-eps)**2 + y**2)\n        ny_plus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y+eps)**2)\n        ny_minus = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + (y-eps)**2)\n\n        grad_n_x = (nx_plus - nx_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n_y = (ny_plus - ny_minus) / (2*eps)\n        grad_n = np.array([grad_n_x, grad_n_y])\n\n        # Current n value\n        current_n = n0 - gradient_strength * np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)\n\n        # Calculate the perpendicular component of gradient\n        t = v[i-1] / np.linalg.norm(v[i-1])  # Tangent vector (normalized velocity)\n        grad_n_parallel = np.dot(grad_n, t) * t  # Component along ray direction\n        grad_n_perp = grad_n - grad_n_parallel  # Perpendicular component\n\n        # Update velocity - rays bend toward higher refractive index\n        a = grad_n_perp / current_n\n        v[i] = v[i-1] + a * dt\n        v[i] = v[i] / np.linalg.norm(v[i])  # Ensure unit speed\n\n        # Update position\n        r[i] = r[i-1] + v[i] * dt\n\n    return r\n\n# Calculate several ray paths\nstart_positions = [\n    [-4, 2.5], [-4, 1.5], [-4, 0.5],\n    [-4, -0.5], [-4, -1.5], [-4, -2.5]\n]\npaths = []\n\nfor start_pos in start_positions:\n    path = ray_path(start_pos, [1, 0], steps=500)\n    paths.append(path)\n    ax.plot(path[:, 0], path[:, 1], 'r-', linewidth=1.5)\n\n# Add start points\nfor pos in start_positions:\n    ax.plot(pos[0], pos[1], 'ro')\n\n# Add axis labels\nax.set_xlabel('x position')\nax.set_ylabel('y position')\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-5, 5)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4— F=ma optics - Light rays (red) following paths toward regions of higher refractive index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most important optical elements are lenses, which come in many different flavors. They consist of curved surfaces, which most commonly have the shape of a part of a spherical cap. It is, therefore, useful to have a look at the refraction at spherical surfaces.\n\n\nFor our calculations of the refraction at spherical surfaces, we consider the sketch below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5— Refraction at a curved surface.\n\n\n\nTo derive an imaging equation for a lens, we aim to calculate the distance \\(b\\) and angle \\(\\theta_2\\) at which a ray crosses the optical axis, given its origin at distance \\(a\\) and angle \\(\\theta_1\\). We begin with Snell’s law for the geometry:\n\\[n_{1}\\sin(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_{2}\\sin(\\alpha-\\theta_2)\\]\nWe define key relationships:\n\\[\\sin(\\alpha)=\\frac{y}{R}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_1)=\\frac{y}{a}, \\quad \\tan(\\theta_2)=\\frac{y}{b}\\]\nTo simplify this, we employ the paraxial approximation, which assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use first-order approximations of trigonometric functions, effectively linearizing them:\n\\[\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta+ O(\\theta^{3}), \\quad \\tan(\\theta) \\approx \\theta + O(\\theta^{3}),\\quad \\cos(\\theta)\\approx 1 + O(\\theta^{2})\\]\nThis approach, common in optics, significantly simplifies our calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nWith the help of these approximations we can write Snell’s law for the curved surface as\n\\[n_1(\\alpha+\\theta_1)=n_2(\\alpha-\\theta_2).\\]\nWith some slight transformation which you will find in the video of the online lecture we obtain, therefore,\n\\[\\theta_2=\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_2 R}y -\\frac{n_1}{n_2}\\theta_1,\\]\nwhich is a purely linear equation in \\(y\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParaxial Approximation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paraxial approximation is a fundamental simplification in optics that assumes all angles are small. This allows us to use linear approximations for trigonometric functions, significantly simplifying calculations while maintaining accuracy for most practical scenarios involving lenses.\nTo visualize the validity of this approximation, let’s examine two plots:\n\nThe first plot compares sin(θ) (blue line) with its linear approximation θ (red dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to π/2 radians.\nThe second plot shows the absolute error between sin(θ) and θ.\n\nThese plots demonstrate that:\n\nFor small angles (roughly up to 0.5 radians or about 30 degrees), the approximation is very close to the actual sine function.\nThe error increases rapidly for larger angles, indicating the limitations of the paraxial approximation.\n\nIn most optical systems, especially those involving lenses, the angles of incident and refracted rays are typically small enough for this approximation to be valid. However, it’s important to be aware of its limitations when dealing with wide-angle optical systems or scenarios where precision is critical.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Define the range of angles (in radians)\ntheta = np.linspace(0, np.pi/2, 1000)\n\n# Calculate sin(theta) and theta (linear approximation)\nsin_theta = np.sin(theta)\nlinear_approx = theta\n\n# Calculate the absolute error\nerror = np.abs(sin_theta - linear_approx)\n\n# Create the plot with two subplots side by side\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7.5, 4))\n\n# Plot sin(theta) and theta on the first subplot\nax1.plot(theta, sin_theta, label='sin(θ)', color='blue')\nax1.plot(theta, linear_approx, label='θ', color='red', linestyle='--')\nax1.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax1.set_ylabel(r'$\\sin(x),x$')\nax1.legend()\n\n# Plot the error on the second subplot\nax2.plot(theta, error, label='Absolute Error', color='green')\nax2.set_xlabel(r'$\\theta$ [rad]')\nax2.set_ylabel('|sin(θ) - θ|')\nax2.legend()\n\n# Adjust the layout and display the plot\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of the paraxial approximation plotting the \\(\\sin(\\theta)\\) and the linear approximation \\(\\theta\\) (dashed line) for angles ranging from 0 to \\(\\pi/2\\) radians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider light originating from a point at distance \\(y\\) from the optical axis.

Here, light travels from \\(n_2\\) back into \\(n_1\\). The radius \\(R_2\\) of this surface often has a negative value in a converging lens due to its opposite curvature relative to the optical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7— Refraction on two spherical surfaces.\n\n\n\nFor thin lenses, where the thickness \\(d\\) is much smaller than \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\) (\\(d \\ll R_1, R_2\\)), we can simplify our analysis. We assume that the height of the ray at both surfaces is approximately equal (\\(y \\approx y'\\)), neglecting the displacement inside the lens.\nThis simplification allows us to treat all refraction as occurring on a single plane at the lens center, known as the principal plane. This concept, illustrated by the dashed line in the figure, greatly simplifies optical calculations and ray tracing for thin lenses.\nThe radii’s sign convention (positive for convex surfaces facing incident light, negative for concave) and this two-surface analysis form the basis for the thin lens formula. This formula relates object distance, image distance, and focal length, encapsulating the lens’s imaging properties.\nThe result of the above calculation is leading to the imaging equation for the thin lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImaging Equation for Thin Lens\n\n\n\nThe sum of the inverse object and image distances equals the inverse focal length of the thin lens:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}\\approx\\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left (\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right )=\\frac{1}{f}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLensmaker equation\n\n\n\nThe focal length of a thin lens is calculated by the lensmaker equation: \\[f=\\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left ( \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2 -R_1}\\right)\\]\nin the paraxial approximation.\n\n\n\n\nImages of objects can be now constructed if we refer to rays which do not emerge from a position on the optical axis only. In this case, we consider three different rays (two are actually enough). If we use as in the case of a concave mirror a central and a parallel ray, we will find a position where all rays cross on the other side. The conversion of the rays is exactly the same as in the case of a spherical mirror. The relation between the position of the object and the image along the optical axis is described by the imaging equation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8— Image construction on a thin lens.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the concave mirror, we may now also find out the image size or the magnification of the lens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnification of a Lens\n\n\n\nThe magnification is given by:\n\\[M=\\frac{h_{\\rm image}}{h_{\\rm object}}=-\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{f}{f-a}\\]\nwhere the negative sign is the result of the reverse orientation of the real images created by a lens.\n\n\nAccording to our previous consideration \\(M&lt;0\\) corresponds to a reversed image, while it is upright as the object for \\(M&gt;0\\). We, therefore, easily see the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject Position\nImage Characteristics\nMagnification (M)\nImage Type\n\n\n\n\n\\(a &lt; f\\)\nUpright and magnified\n\\(M &gt; 0\\)\nVirtual\n\n\n\\(f &lt; a &lt; 2f\\)\nReversed and magnified\n\\(M &lt; -1\\)\nReal\n\n\n\\(a = 2f\\)\nReversed, same size\n\\(M = -1\\)\nReal\n\n\n\\(a &gt; 2f\\)\nReversed and shrunk\n\\(-1 &lt; M &lt; 0\\)\nReal\n\n\n\\(a = f\\)\nAppears at infinity\n\\(M = \\infty\\)\n-\n\n\n\nThe image below illustrates the construction of images in 4 of the above cases for a bi-convex lens, including the generation of a virtual image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig.: Image construction on a biconvex lens with a parallel and a central ray for different object distances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix Optics\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above derived equations for a single spherical surface yield a linear relation between the input variables \\(y_1\\) and \\(\\theta_1\\) and the output variables \\(y_2\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). The linear relation yields a great opportunity to express optical elements in terms of linear transformations (matrices). This is the basis of matrix optics. The matrix representation of a lens is given by\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nwhere the matrix is called the ABCD matrix of the lens. Due to the linearization of Snells law w can write down more generally\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\\n\\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ \\theta_1 \\end{pmatrix}\\]\nand one can obtain a Matrix for all types of optical elements such as free space of dustance \\(d\\).\n\\[\\begin{bmatrix}\nA & B\\\\\nC & D\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & d\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nHere are some useful matrices for optical elements:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\n1 & d \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Free space}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Planar interface}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{\\left(n_2-n_1\\right)}{n_2 R} & \\frac{n_1}{n_2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Spherical Boundary}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\mathbf{M}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{f} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] \\tag{Tin Lens}\n\\]\nIf we have now a system of optical elements, we can multiply the matrices of the individual elements to obtain the matrix of the whole system.\n\\[\n\\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}_N \\rightarrow \\mathrm{M}=\\mathbf{M}_N \\ldots \\mathrm{M}_2 \\mathbf{M}_1 \\text {. }\n\\]\nThis is a very powerful tool to analyze optical systems.",

Consider a spherical boundary between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\). We’ll place our coordinate system so that the spherical surface intersects the x-axis at x=0, with radius R and its center at position (R,0) to the right.\nFor a point P on the spherical surface at height y from the optical axis, the total optical path length from object point A at (-a,0) to image point B at (b,0) is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nwhere: \\[|AP| = \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}\\] \\[|PB| = \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nAccording to Fermat’s principle, light follows the path where this length is stationary:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dy} = n_1\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} + n_2\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = 0\\]\nComputing these derivatives:\n\\[\\frac{d|AP|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|AP|}\\] \\[\\frac{d|PB|}{dy} = \\frac{y}{|PB|}\\]\nSubstituting into our condition:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = 0\\]\nThis equation is incorrect. The right-hand side should not be zero because we need to account for the geometry of the spherical surface. The correct form includes the effect of the surface normal:\n\\[n_1\\frac{y}{|AP|} + n_2\\frac{y}{|PB|} = \\frac{(n_2-n_1)y}{R}\\]\nThis correction comes from the fact that at point P, the normal to the spherical surface makes an angle α with the optical axis, where sin(α) ≈ y/R in the paraxial approximation.\nDividing by y (assuming y≠0):\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{|AP|} + \\frac{n_2}{|PB|} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nIn the paraxial approximation, we can use |AP| ≈ a and |PB| ≈ b, yielding:\n\\[\\frac{n_1}{a} + \\frac{n_2}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{R}\\]\nThis is the correct imaging equation for a spherical refracting surface.\nThe elegance of Fermat’s principle is preserved, as it still naturally produces the same result as our geometric derivation, once we properly account for the geometry of the refracting surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeriving the Thin Lens Equation from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\n\nTo derive the thin lens equation, we apply Fermat’s principle to the two spherical surfaces that make up a lens. Consider a lens with refractive index \\(n_2\\) in a medium of index \\(n_1\\), with surface radii \\(R_1\\) and \\(R_2\\).\nThe total optical path for a ray passing through the lens at height \\(y\\) from the optical axis is: - Path from object to first surface: \\(n_1 s_1\\) - Path through the lens: \\(n_2 s_2\\) - Path from second surface to image: \\(n_1 s_3\\)\nFor a thin lens, the optical path length simplifies to:\n\\[L(y) = n_1 \\sqrt{a^2 + y^2} + n_2 d(y) + n_1 \\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}\\]\nWhere \\(d(y)\\) is the thickness of the lens at height \\(y\\), which can be approximated as:\n\\[d(y) \\approx d_0 + \\frac{y^2}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)\\]\nApplying Fermat’s principle (\\(\\frac{dL}{dy} = 0\\)) and using the paraxial approximation:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{a^2 + y^2}} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{\\sqrt{b^2 + y^2}} = 0\\]\nIn the paraxial limit (\\(y \\ll a, y \\ll b\\)), this becomes:\n\\[\\frac{n_1 y}{a} + n_2 y \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) + \\frac{n_1 y}{b} = 0\\]\nDividing by \\(y\\) and rearranging:\n\\[\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} = \\frac{n_2-n_1}{n_1}\\left(\\frac{1}{R_1}-\\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis is the thin lens equation with the focal length given by the lensmaker’s equation:\n\\[f = \\frac{n_1}{n_2-n_1}\\left(\\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2-R_1}\\right)\\]\nThus, both the imaging equation and the lensmaker equation emerge naturally from Fermat’s principle applied to the geometry of a thin lens, showing that light follows paths of equal optical length from object to image when passing through any part of the lens.\nFrom a wave perspective, what makes a lens focus light to a point is that all paths from object to image through any part of the lens have equal optical path lengths (to first order in the paraxial approximation), ensuring constructive interference at the image point.",
