The total path length is \\(L = |AP| + |PB|\\). According to Fermat’s Principle, the actual path minimizes \\(L\\), so we set:\n\\[\\frac{dL}{dx} = 0\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is the position of P. After calculus manipulation, this yields the familiar law of reflection:\n\\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the surface.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_optical_path(x, start, end, n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total optical path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = n1 * np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)  # Optical path in medium 1\n    d2 = n2 * np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)      # Optical path in medium 2\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 8))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, -3)\n\n# Define refractive indices\nn1 = 1.0  # Medium 1 (above interface)\nn2 = 1.5  # Medium 2 (below interface)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate optical path lengths\noptical_paths = [calculate_optical_path(x, start_point, end_point, n1, n2) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(optical_paths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5, alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-', lw=1)\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go', label='end')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro', label='refraction')\n\n# Calculate and draw angles\n# Incident ray\ndx1 = min_x - start_point[0]\ndy1 = 0 - start_point[1]\nincident_angle = np.arctan2(-dy1, dx1)\ntheta1 = np.pi/2 - incident_angle\n\n# Refracted ray\ndx2 = end_point[0] - min_x\ndy2 = end_point[1] - 0\nrefracted_angle = np.arctan2(dy2, dx2)\ntheta2 = np.pi/2 + refracted_angle\n\n# Draw angle arcs\n\n# Add angle labels\nax.text(min_x + 0.3, 0.3, r'$\\theta_1$', color='blue')\nax.text(min_x - 0.5, -0.3, r'$\\theta_2$', color='green')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-3, 0.5, f\"n₁ = {n1}\", color='blue')\nax.text(-3, -0.5, f\"n₂ = {n2}\", color='green')\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s Law from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\nRefraction Similarly, for refraction between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\), the optical path length is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nApplying Fermat’s Principle and solving the resulting equation leads to Snell’s law:\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\nThese fundamental laws allow us to analyze the formation of images by various optical systems. For instance, in a thin lens with focal length \\(f\\), we can establish the relationship between object distance \\(s_o\\), image distance \\(s_i\\), and focal length through the lens equation:\n\\[\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis equation enables us to predict image formation characteristics in optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.\nDespite its power, ray optics has limitations. It cannot explain phenomena like diffraction, which occurs when light encounters obstacles or apertures comparable to its wavelength. Here, we need wave optics for a complete description. Additionally, ray optics fails to account for the finite width of beams and the existence of evanescent waves.\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 7))\n\n# Define lens parameters\nf = 2  # focal length\nh_obj = 1.5  # object height\ns_o = 6  # object distance\ns_i = 1/(1/f - 1/s_o)  # image distance from lens formula\nh_img = -h_obj * s_i/s_o  # image height\n\n# Plot optical axis\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=0.5)\n\n# Plot lens\nlens_height = 3\nax.plot([0, 0], [-lens_height/2, lens_height/2], 'k-', linewidth=1)\n# Add curved edges to represent a lens\ncurve_x = np.linspace(-0.1, 0, 20)\ncurve_y1 = lens_height/2 * np.sqrt(1 - (curve_x/0.1)**2)\ncurve_y2 = -lens_height/2 * np.sqrt(1 - (curve_x/0.1)**2)\nax.plot(curve_x, curve_y1, 'k-', linewidth=1)\nax.plot(curve_x, curve_y2, 'k-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot focal points\nax.plot(f, 0, 'ko', markersize=2)\nax.plot(-f, 0, 'ko', markersize=2)\nax.text(f, -0.4, r'$F$', fontsize=10)\nax.text(-f, -0.4, r\"$F'$\", fontsize=10)\n\n# Plot object and image\nax.arrow(-s_o, 0, 0, h_obj-0.1, head_width=0.1, head_length=0.1, fc='blue', ec='blue', linewidth=1)\nax.arrow(s_i, 0, 0, h_img+0.1, head_width=0.1, head_length=0.1, fc='red', ec='red', linewidth=1)\nax.text(-s_o+0.1, h_obj/2, r'object', color='blue', fontsize=7)\nax.text(s_i+0.1, h_img/2, r'image', color='red', fontsize=7)\n\n# Principal rays\n# Ray 1: Parallel to axis, through focal point\nax.plot([-s_o, 0], [h_obj, h_obj], 'b-')\nax.plot([0, s_i], [h_obj, h_img], 'b-' )\n\n# Ray 2: Through center, unchanged direction\nax.plot([-s_o, s_i], [h_obj, h_img], 'g-')\n\n# Ray 3: Through focal point, parallel to axis\nax.plot([-s_o, 0], [h_obj, 0], 'r-', linewidth=1)\nax.plot([0, s_i], [0, h_img], 'r-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Add lens equation\nequation_text = r\"$\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f}$\"\nax.text(-5, -1.5, equation_text, fontsize=12, bbox=dict(facecolor='white', lw=0,\n    alpha=0.7))\n\n# Labels showing values\nax.text(-s_o/2, 0.2, f\"$s_o = {s_o}$\", fontsize=9)\nax.text(s_i/2, 0.4, f\"$s_i = {s_i:.2f}$\", fontsize=9)\nax.text(0, -2, f\"$f = {f}$\", fontsize=9)\n\n# Set plot limits and aspect ratio\nax.set_xlim(-s_o-1, s_i+1)\nax.set_ylim(-2.5, 2.5)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n# Axis labels\nax.set_xlabel('position')\nax.set_ylabel('height')\n\n# Add legend for principal rays\nfrom matplotlib.lines import Line2D\nlegend_elements = [\n    Line2D([0], [0], color='blue', lw=1, label='Parallel to axis → through F'),\n    Line2D([0], [0], color='green', lw=1, label='Through center'),\n    Line2D([0], [0], color='red', lw=1, label='Through F → parallel to axis')\n]\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nRay diagram for a thin lens showing object and image formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive Interference of Non-Minimal Paths\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can demonstrate that all paths except the shortest one interfere destructively using Feynman’s path integral formulation. In this approach, light takes all possible paths between points A and B, with each path contributing an amplitude with phase \\(e^{iS/\\hbar}\\), where \\(S\\) is the action proportional to the optical path length: \\(S = kL\\) where \\(k = 2\\pi/\\lambda\\) is the wave number.\nTo understand why non-minimal paths cancel out, let’s denote the minimal path as \\(x_0(t)\\) and nearby paths as \\(x_0(t) + \\delta x(t)\\), where \\(\\delta x(t)\\) represents small deviations. The action for these perturbed paths expands as: \\[S[x_0 + \\delta x] = S[x_0] + \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\delta x + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x)^2 + ...\\]\nSince \\(x_0\\) is the extremal path (according to Fermat’s principle), we have \\(\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}\\bigg|_{x_0} = 0\\). This means the first-order term vanishes, leaving the quadratic term as the leading contribution to the phase difference:\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = S[x] - S[x_0] \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x)^2\\]\nThis quadratic dependence is crucial: as we move away from the minimal path, the phase difference increases as the square of the deviation \\(\\delta x\\). When we consider a specific deviation \\(\\delta x_c\\) where \\(\\Delta\\phi = \\pi\\), paths will contribute with exactly opposite phases compared to the minimal path, leading to destructive interference:\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x_c)^2 = \\pi\\]\nFor even larger deviations, the phase differences continue to increase, creating alternating bands of constructive and destructive interference. When summed over all possible paths, these rapidly varying phases cancel each other out.\nFor paths far from the minimal one, the destructive interference is even more pronounced. Mathematically, we can demonstrate this by considering a continuous distribution of paths with optical path lengths \\(L\\). The total amplitude contribution from these paths is given by:\n\\[A = \\int e^{ikL(x)} dx\\]\nFor non-minimal paths, we can parametrize the path length as \\(L(x) = L_0 + \\alpha(x-x_0)^2\\) for some constant \\(\\alpha\\), where \\(x_0\\) corresponds to the minimal path. The amplitude becomes:\n\\[A = \\int e^{ik(L_0 + \\alpha(x-x_0)^2)} dx = e^{ikL_0}\\int e^{ik\\alpha(x-x_0)^2} dx\\]\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\\[A = e^{ikL_0}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{k\\alpha}}e^{i\\pi/4}\\]\nThe key insight is that the amplitude scales as \\(1/\\sqrt{k\\alpha}\\), which means that as the curvature \\(\\alpha\\) of the path length function increases (as happens far from the minimal path), the contribution to the total amplitude diminishes. This mathematically proves why non-minimal path regions contribute negligibly to the overall path integral.\nThis cancellation mechanism explains why light appears to follow only the path of least time in ray optics. The mathematics shows that constructive interference occurs only for paths very close to the minimal path, while all other paths destructively interfere with their neighbors. This phenomenon emerges naturally from wave properties without requiring quantum mechanical constants like ℏ. We can express this classically by setting \\(S = kL\\) and observing how path differences relative to the wavelength create interference patterns.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(12, 6))\n\n# Parameters\nnum_paths = 100\nmin_path_index = num_paths // 2\npath_deviation = np.linspace(-2, 2, num_paths)  # Deviation from minimal path\nalpha = 5  # Curvature parameter controlling phase variation rate\n\n# Calculate phase for each path (quadratic dependence on deviation)\nphases = alpha * path_deviation**2\n\n# Generate complex amplitudes for each path\namplitudes = np.exp(1j * phases)\n\n# Plot phase distribution on unit circle\naxs[0].plot(np.cos(phases), np.sin(phases), 'o', markersize=3, alpha=0.7)\naxs[0].plot([0, np.real(np.sum(amplitudes)/20)], [0, np.imag(np.sum(amplitudes)/20)],\n           'r-', linewidth=2, label='Sum (scaled)')\n\n# Highlight paths near minimal path\nnear_minimal = np.abs(path_deviation) &lt; 0.3\naxs[0].plot(np.cos(phases[near_minimal]), np.sin(phases[near_minimal]), 'o',\n           color='green', markersize=5, label='Near minimal path')\n\n# Add unit circle\ntheta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)\naxs[0].plot(np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta), 'k--', alpha=0.3)\naxs[0].set_aspect('equal')\naxs[0].set_xlim(-1.1, 1.1)\naxs[0].set_ylim(-1.1, 1.1)\naxs[0].set_xlabel('Re(amplitude)')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('Im(amplitude)')\n#axs[0].set_title('Phase Distribution on Unit Circle')\naxs[0].grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n#axs[0].legend()\n\n# Plot path contributions with their phases\ncmap = cm.hsv\ncolors = cmap(phases / (2*np.pi) % 1)\n\naxs[1].bar(path_deviation, np.ones_like(path_deviation), width=0.05,\n          color=colors, alpha=0.7, edgecolor='k', linewidth=0.2)\naxs[1].axvline(x=0, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Minimal path')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('Path deviation')\naxs[1].set_ylabel('Contribution')\n#axs[1].set_title('Path Contributions with Phase Color Coding')\n\n# Add a colorbar for phase reference\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap=cmap, norm=plt.Normalize(0, 2*np.pi))\nsm.set_array([])\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, ax=axs[1], orientation='vertical', label='Phase')\ncbar.set_ticks([0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3*np.pi/2, 2*np.pi])\ncbar.set_ticklabels(['0', 'π/2', 'π', '3π/2', '2π'])\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of path phases in Fermat’s principle",

After calculus manipulation, this yields the familiar law of reflection:\n\\[\\theta_i = \\theta_r\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_i\\) is the angle of incidence and \\(\\theta_r\\) is the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the surface.\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_optical_path(x, start, end, n1, n2):\n    \"\"\"Calculate the total optical path length from start to point x to end\"\"\"\n    d1 = n1 * np.sqrt((x - start[0])**2 + (start[1])**2)  # Optical path in medium 1\n    d2 = n2 * np.sqrt((end[0] - x)**2 + (end[1])**2)      # Optical path in medium 2\n    return d1 + d2\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 8))\n\n# Define start and end points\nstart_point = (-4, 3)\nend_point = (4, -3)\n\n# Define refractive indices\nn1 = 1.0  # Medium 1 (above interface)\nn2 = 1.5  # Medium 2 (below interface)\n\n# X positions for different possible paths\nx_positions = np.linspace(-3.5, 3.5, 15)\n\n# Calculate optical path lengths\noptical_paths = [calculate_optical_path(x, start_point, end_point, n1, n2) for x in x_positions]\n\n# Find the minimum path (Fermat's principle)\nmin_index = np.argmin(optical_paths)\nmin_x = x_positions[min_index]\n\n# Plot the horizontal line (interface)\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot all possible paths\nfor i, x in enumerate(x_positions):\n    if i == min_index:\n        continue  # Skip the minimum path for now\n\n    # Create path\n    verts = [\n        start_point,\n        (x, 0),\n        end_point\n    ]\n    codes = [\n        Path.MOVETO,\n        Path.LINETO,\n        Path.LINETO\n    ]\n    path = Path(verts, codes)\n    patch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='gray',\n                             linestyle='--', lw=0.5, alpha=0.65)\n    ax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Plot the minimum path (Fermat's Principle)\nverts = [\n    start_point,\n    (min_x, 0),\n    end_point\n]\ncodes = [\n    Path.MOVETO,\n    Path.LINETO,\n    Path.LINETO\n]\npath = Path(verts, codes)\npatch = patches.PathPatch(path, facecolor='none', edgecolor='red',\n                         linestyle='-', lw=1)\nax.add_patch(patch)\n\n# Add dots for the points\nax.plot(start_point[0], start_point[1], 'bo', label='start')\nax.plot(end_point[0], end_point[1], 'go', label='end')\nax.plot(min_x, 0, 'ro', label='refraction')\n\n# Calculate and draw angles\n# Incident ray\ndx1 = min_x - start_point[0]\ndy1 = 0 - start_point[1]\nincident_angle = np.arctan2(-dy1, dx1)\ntheta1 = np.pi/2 - incident_angle\n\n# Refracted ray\ndx2 = end_point[0] - min_x\ndy2 = end_point[1] - 0\nrefracted_angle = np.arctan2(dy2, dx2)\ntheta2 = np.pi/2 + refracted_angle\n\n# Draw angle arcs\n\n# Add angle labels\nax.text(min_x + 0.3, 0.3, r'$\\theta_1$', color='blue')\nax.text(min_x - 0.5, -0.3, r'$\\theta_2$', color='green')\n\n# Set labels and title\nax.set_xlabel('x-position')\nax.set_ylabel('y-position')\nax.text(-3, 0.5, f\"n₁ = {n1}\", color='blue')\nax.text(-3, -0.5, f\"n₂ = {n2}\", color='green')\n\n# Set plot limits and legend\nax.set_xlim(-5, 5)\nax.set_ylim(-4, 4)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nSnell’s Law from Fermat’s Principle\n\n\n\n\nRefraction Similarly, for refraction between two media with refractive indices \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\), the optical path length is:\n\\[L = n_1|AP| + n_2|PB|\\]\nApplying Fermat’s Principle and solving the resulting equation leads to Snell’s law:\n\\[n_1\\sin\\theta_1 = n_2\\sin\\theta_2\\]\nwhere \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.\nThese fundamental laws allow us to analyze the formation of images by various optical systems. For instance, in a thin lens with focal length \\(f\\), we can establish the relationship between object distance \\(s_o\\), image distance \\(s_i\\), and focal length through the lens equation:\n\\[\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f}\\]\nThis equation enables us to predict image formation characteristics in optical instruments such as cameras, microscopes, and telescopes.\nDespite its power, ray optics has limitations. It cannot explain phenomena like diffraction, which occurs when light encounters obstacles or apertures comparable to its wavelength. Here, we need wave optics for a complete description. Additionally, ray optics fails to account for the finite width of beams and the existence of evanescent waves.\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=get_size(12, 7))\n\n# Define lens parameters\nf = 2  # focal length\nh_obj = 1.5  # object height\ns_o = 6  # object distance\ns_i = 1/(1/f - 1/s_o)  # image distance from lens formula\nh_img = -h_obj * s_i/s_o  # image height\n\n# Plot optical axis\nax.axhline(y=0, color='black', linestyle='-', linewidth=0.5)\n\n# Plot lens\nlens_height = 3\nax.plot([0, 0], [-lens_height/2, lens_height/2], 'k-', linewidth=1)\n# Add curved edges to represent a lens\ncurve_x = np.linspace(-0.1, 0, 20)\ncurve_y1 = lens_height/2 * np.sqrt(1 - (curve_x/0.1)**2)\ncurve_y2 = -lens_height/2 * np.sqrt(1 - (curve_x/0.1)**2)\nax.plot(curve_x, curve_y1, 'k-', linewidth=1)\nax.plot(curve_x, curve_y2, 'k-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Plot focal points\nax.plot(f, 0, 'ko', markersize=2)\nax.plot(-f, 0, 'ko', markersize=2)\nax.text(f, -0.4, r'$F$', fontsize=10)\nax.text(-f, -0.4, r\"$F'$\", fontsize=10)\n\n# Plot object and image\nax.arrow(-s_o, 0, 0, h_obj-0.1, head_width=0.1, head_length=0.1, fc='blue', ec='blue', linewidth=1)\nax.arrow(s_i, 0, 0, h_img+0.1, head_width=0.1, head_length=0.1, fc='red', ec='red', linewidth=1)\nax.text(-s_o+0.1, h_obj/2, r'object', color='blue', fontsize=7)\nax.text(s_i+0.1, h_img/2, r'image', color='red', fontsize=7)\n\n# Principal rays\n# Ray 1: Parallel to axis, through focal point\nax.plot([-s_o, 0], [h_obj, h_obj], 'b-')\nax.plot([0, s_i], [h_obj, h_img], 'b-' )\n\n# Ray 2: Through center, unchanged direction\nax.plot([-s_o, s_i], [h_obj, h_img], 'g-')\n\n# Ray 3: Through focal point, parallel to axis\nax.plot([-s_o, 0], [h_obj, 0], 'r-', linewidth=1)\nax.plot([0, s_i], [0, h_img], 'r-', linewidth=1)\n\n# Add lens equation\nequation_text = r\"$\\frac{1}{s_o} + \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\frac{1}{f}$\"\nax.text(-5, -1.5, equation_text, fontsize=12, bbox=dict(facecolor='white', lw=0,\n    alpha=0.7))\n\n# Labels showing values\nax.text(-s_o/2, 0.2, f\"$s_o = {s_o}$\", fontsize=9)\nax.text(s_i/2, 0.4, f\"$s_i = {s_i:.2f}$\", fontsize=9)\nax.text(0, -2, f\"$f = {f}$\", fontsize=9)\n\n# Set plot limits and aspect ratio\nax.set_xlim(-s_o-1, s_i+1)\nax.set_ylim(-2.5, 2.5)\nax.set_aspect('equal')\n\n# Axis labels\nax.set_xlabel('position')\nax.set_ylabel('height')\n\n# Add legend for principal rays\nfrom matplotlib.lines import Line2D\nlegend_elements = [\n    Line2D([0], [0], color='blue', lw=1, label='Parallel to axis → through F'),\n    Line2D([0], [0], color='green', lw=1, label='Through center'),\n    Line2D([0], [0], color='red', lw=1, label='Through F → parallel to axis')\n]\n\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nRay diagram for a thin lens showing object and image formation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestructive Interference of Non-Minimal Paths\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can demonstrate that all paths except the shortest one interfere destructively using Feynman’s path integral formulation. In this approach, light takes all possible paths between points A and B, with each path contributing an amplitude with phase \\(e^{iS/\\hbar}\\), where \\(S\\) is the action proportional to the optical path length: \\(S = kL\\) where \\(k = 2\\pi/\\lambda\\) is the wave number.\nTo understand why non-minimal paths cancel out, let’s denote the minimal path as \\(x_0(t)\\) and nearby paths as \\(x_0(t) + \\delta x(t)\\), where \\(\\delta x(t)\\) represents small deviations. The action for these perturbed paths expands as: \\[S[x_0 + \\delta x] = S[x_0] + \\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}\\bigg|_{x_0} \\delta x + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x)^2 + ...\\]\nSince \\(x_0\\) is the extremal path (according to Fermat’s principle), we have \\(\\frac{\\delta S}{\\delta x}\\bigg|_{x_0} = 0\\). This means the first-order term vanishes, leaving the quadratic term as the leading contribution to the phase difference:\n\\[\\Delta\\phi = S[x] - S[x_0] \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x)^2\\]\nThis quadratic dependence is crucial: as we move away from the minimal path, the phase difference increases as the square of the deviation \\(\\delta x\\). When we consider a specific deviation \\(\\delta x_c\\) where \\(\\Delta\\phi = \\pi\\), paths will contribute with exactly opposite phases compared to the minimal path, leading to destructive interference:\n\\[\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\delta^2 S}{\\delta x^2}\\bigg|_{x_0} (\\delta x_c)^2 = \\pi\\]\nFor even larger deviations, the phase differences continue to increase, creating alternating bands of constructive and destructive interference. When summed over all possible paths, these rapidly varying phases cancel each other out.\nFor paths far from the minimal one, the destructive interference is even more pronounced. Mathematically, we can demonstrate this by considering a continuous distribution of paths with optical path lengths \\(L\\). The total amplitude contribution from these paths is given by:\n\\[A = \\int e^{ikL(x)} dx\\]\nFor non-minimal paths, we can parametrize the path length as \\(L(x) = L_0 + \\alpha(x-x_0)^2\\) for some constant \\(\\alpha\\), where \\(x_0\\) corresponds to the minimal path. The amplitude becomes:\n\\[A = \\int e^{ik(L_0 + \\alpha(x-x_0)^2)} dx = e^{ikL_0}\\int e^{ik\\alpha(x-x_0)^2} dx\\]\nThis integral evaluates to:\n\\[A = e^{ikL_0}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{k\\alpha}}e^{i\\pi/4}\\]\nThe key insight is that the amplitude scales as \\(1/\\sqrt{k\\alpha}\\), which means that as the curvature \\(\\alpha\\) of the path length function increases (as happens far from the minimal path), the contribution to the total amplitude diminishes. This mathematically proves why non-minimal path regions contribute negligibly to the overall path integral.\nThis cancellation mechanism explains why light appears to follow only the path of least time in ray optics. The mathematics shows that constructive interference occurs only for paths very close to the minimal path, while all other paths destructively interfere with their neighbors. This phenomenon emerges naturally from wave properties without requiring quantum mechanical constants like ℏ. We can express this classically by setting \\(S = kL\\) and observing how path differences relative to the wavelength create interference patterns.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import cm\n\n# Set up the figure\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=get_size(12, 6))\n\n# Parameters\nnum_paths = 100\nmin_path_index = num_paths // 2\npath_deviation = np.linspace(-2, 2, num_paths)  # Deviation from minimal path\nalpha = 5  # Curvature parameter controlling phase variation rate\n\n# Calculate phase for each path (quadratic dependence on deviation)\nphases = alpha * path_deviation**2\n\n# Generate complex amplitudes for each path\namplitudes = np.exp(1j * phases)\n\n# Plot phase distribution on unit circle\naxs[0].plot(np.cos(phases), np.sin(phases), 'o', markersize=3, alpha=0.7)\naxs[0].plot([0, np.real(np.sum(amplitudes)/20)], [0, np.imag(np.sum(amplitudes)/20)],\n           'r-', linewidth=2, label='Sum (scaled)')\n\n# Highlight paths near minimal path\nnear_minimal = np.abs(path_deviation) &lt; 0.3\naxs[0].plot(np.cos(phases[near_minimal]), np.sin(phases[near_minimal]), 'o',\n           color='green', markersize=5, label='Near minimal path')\n\n# Add unit circle\ntheta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)\naxs[0].plot(np.cos(theta), np.sin(theta), 'k--', alpha=0.3)\naxs[0].set_aspect('equal')\naxs[0].set_xlim(-1.1, 1.1)\naxs[0].set_ylim(-1.1, 1.1)\naxs[0].set_xlabel('Re(amplitude)')\naxs[0].set_ylabel('Im(amplitude)')\n#axs[0].set_title('Phase Distribution on Unit Circle')\naxs[0].grid(True, alpha=0.3)\n#axs[0].legend()\n\n# Plot path contributions with their phases\ncmap = cm.hsv\ncolors = cmap(phases / (2*np.pi) % 1)\n\naxs[1].bar(path_deviation, np.ones_like(path_deviation), width=0.05,\n          color=colors, alpha=0.7, edgecolor='k', linewidth=0.2)\naxs[1].axvline(x=0, color='r', linestyle='--', label='Minimal path')\naxs[1].set_xlabel('Path deviation')\naxs[1].set_ylabel('Contribution')\n#axs[1].set_title('Path Contributions with Phase Color Coding')\n\n# Add a colorbar for phase reference\nsm = plt.cm.ScalarMappable(cmap=cmap, norm=plt.Normalize(0, 2*np.pi))\nsm.set_array([])\ncbar = fig.colorbar(sm, ax=axs[1], orientation='vertical', label='Phase')\ncbar.set_ticks([0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3*np.pi/2, 2*np.pi])\ncbar.set_ticklabels(['0', 'π/2', 'π', '3π/2', '2π'])\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization of path phases in Fermat’s principle",
